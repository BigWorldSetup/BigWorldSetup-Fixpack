-There has been made a secret alliance of dark gods and powers, headed by Lolth herself.
-This is not a new thing, often various gods both light and dark have worked together for some common goal but this is different and worrying in two ways.
-First the alliance is composed of many who had previously been at war, namely Orcus and Balrog who hate one another, to unify such long time opponents there must be such a prize for both that should make the forces of good and light very very worried.
-Second the alliance obviously has some purpose, since I have been aware of this alliance Lolth , Balrog, Orcus and many other dark minions have been seen in all parts of the multiverse collecting rare minerals, magics and lore.
+@65=~Child of Bhaal, it has come to my attention that a terrible threat to the Planes has emerged. For this reason, I address you directly.
+
+An alliance of dark powers has been forged, spear-headed by Lolth herself.
+It is not unusual for various gods, both light and dark, to operate in unison. However, this matter is different.
+This alliance is composed of many who had previously been at war. For Orcus and Balrog, who have hated one another for ages untold, to unify under Lolth's banner betrays a dangerous confidence in their ability to triumph over the forces of light. Many of their dark minions have been spotted in all parts of the multiverse, pillaging valuable minerals, magics and lore.
 
-Both these things alone would suggest we should investigate further, together they spell real trouble.
+Fortunately, our enemies' inability to keep secrets from me has revealed their motives. The enemy has recovered a set of other-worldy artifacts of arcane power, only known as the Hand and the Eye. Presumably they are the remains of a long-gone evil deity of considerable power. That such artifacts even exist is unsettling on its own. Worse, I have been able to surmise that the enemy is attempting to amass an army of constructs, powered by the foul artifact's energies, capable of challenging Mount Celestia itself. One such construct, only known as Construct One, has already been created. 
 
-What works in our favor is the dark powers inability to hold a secret, already I have discovered that they seek to create a base of operations in a pocket plane made from astral debris, apparently they had hoped to obtain a astral shard to hide the location but that plan was recently foiled, anyway it would take an astral map to find the place and they most certainly would hide that well!!!!
+It is your task to destroy this creature and to return these artifacts safely. 
 
-And then there is that damn prophesy, from the mad Arab, I am sure the two events are linked. So I send you this word child of Bhall, weather you are currently on the side of righteousness or not, you should investigate and play your part in this, I have played my part by bringing you this word, you must do the same and prevent the end Azir has foreseen. For if the end of the gods comes to pass, so will your doom come to pass since the blood of a god flows within you too!
+If this plot is indeed linked to the visions of the Insane Prophet then any further interference on my part might prove disastrous. It would be in your own best interest to challenge the enemy. For if the all the gods are to meet their end, then so shall you, eventually. My part in this ends where yours begins.

 The traveler may choose to leave the border region of the Ethereal plane for the depths of the plane itself. This may be desirable to escape pursuit or a powerful foe, or to reach the inner planes and demi-planes. A traveler can only reach the plane that he is now bordering.

 The portals to the Ethereal look like milky water flowing in a spiral pattern. What the astral traveler is seeing is the end point of an ether al cyclone, where it disrupts the barrier between the Ethereal and Astral planes. Individuals passing from the Ethereal to the Astral are treated as physical-form travelers (they lose their ethereal nature). Travelling from the Astral to the Ethereal in physical form endows the travelers with etherealness. Traveling from the Astral to the Ethereal in astral form results in the creation of an ethereal body in a similar fashion to creation of a body in the outer planes. The ethereal-astral form cannot reenter the Prime Material plane in which the original body resides.

 The Styx is always in motion as it flows through the top layers of each of the seven lower planes. The fifth level of the Nine Hells, which contains the world-ocean Stygia, is connected to the Styx, as are a number of the deeper layers of the Abyss. The Styx does not appear to have a origin oradinal outflow, nor does it move linearly to adjacent planes. Boatmen have been able to pass from Acheron to the Abyss in a matter of hours, without passing through the planes between them. 
 The tangled skein that is the full flow of the Styx has not been measured. Perhaps it cannot be measured, seeing as it is an infinitely long river that passes through a number of infinite planes.

 The river Oceanus links the planes of Elysium, Happy Hunting Grounds, and Olympus in much the same way that the Styx links the lower planes. Like the Styx, the Oceanus disappears and reappears a number of times in different layers of the planes, but it seems to follow a course that begins in Thalasia, the third layer of Elysium, flows through the second and first layers of that plane, then across the topmost layer of the Happy Hunting Grounds, then into the topmost layer of Olympus to its final rest in the second layer of that plane, which is called Ossa.
 The Oceanus is a more natural river than the Styx, and no harm comes to those who drink of it. The Oceanus, however, does pose all the normal dangers of a large river, and does not have the supernatural boatmen of the lifeblood of the lower planes, the Styx.~

 Nirvana is a single infinite plane with planar layers that extend in all directions, without true floor or ceiling. The void is filled, however, with huge interlocking wheels, like the internal cogs 0f an ornately carved clock. These wheels are great platters of matter, however, each 500 miles or more in radius. The plane is filled with an infinite number of these clockwork disks, interlocking along their edges so that the slow revolution of one disk is picked up by adjacent disks and transferred to others so the entire plane spins in unison.
 Each circular realm has its own gravity, so disks can meet at right angles without disturbing the inhabitants of either one. This gravity extends in a sphere above and below each disk, though usually only one side of a disk is inhabited. Those beyond the bounds of any disk's gravity float as in the Astral plane, but there is a subtle tug from nearby realms, so a traveler suspended in space eventually falls within the pull of a.. The space between the disks is air so flying is possible between the realm-disks.
 Free-standing portals to the Prime Material plane usually exist in the center of a realm's inhabited ("topmost") side. These usually lead to planes where the realm's Powers are worshiped, or at least acknowledged. There is no equivalent of the Yggdrasil or Styx in the plane of Nirvana. However, if the Greater Babylonian Power Anu must leave his realm, a temporary conduit known as "Anu's Way" (a red carpet, in effect), bridges Nirvana and the Prime Material through the Astral while Anu is gone. On these occasions, Mardukis summoned from Arcadia to mind Anu's realm. ~

 @315=~ Twin Paradises
 The Twin Paradises are the homes of those spirits and powers that believe in the forces of good. They believe in organization only when necessary or when it is the best method of dealing with a problem. This plane is unique among the outer planes in that the barrier between the two is large, encompassing the upper regions of both layers, and very transparent, so that the surface of one layer can be viewed from the other as a ghostly mirror reflection against the sky.
 The best analogy to the Twin Paradises is a book with no spine. The insides of the two covers are the surfaces of the two layers (facing each other). A traveler standing in one of the layers can look up and see the other layer hanging high overhead (and upside down, according to the traveler's perspective). Gravity functions normally for each layer (each looks look upside down to the other). The two layers are separated by a wide gulf of air (the separation is 20 miles from sea level to sea level). The barrier between the planar layers is in midair, halfway between the layers. A traveler can fly up to the barrier, make the necessary Wisdom Check for crossing the barrier, and then fly down into the other layer. Travelers seeking a more discreet method of traveling between the barriers can climb one of several tall mountains that reach the barrier and connect to a mountain that reaches up from the other layer. Climbing a peak and crossing the barrier without preparation for the reversed direction in gravity can be hazardous, even fatal.
 Each layer gives off a golden-white glow that provides the illumination for this plane. These facing layers of the Paradises are named Shurrockand Dothion. Dothion is usually considered the topmost plane,(nearest the Astral). Portals to the other planes from either layer appear as caverns with patterns shining within. Those with concentric
 circle patterns lead to the Seven Heavens, those with radiating lines lead to Elysium, and those with spiderweb patterns lead to Concordant Opposition. ~

 @318=~Elysium
 Elysium is the plane of ultimate good, unsullied by the concerns of hierarchy or anarchy. The spirits that reside here cannot be summoned or controlled, for they are at final rest. The Powers of the plane answer only those callings that they deem worthy (or profitable).
 The four layers of Elysium are dominated by the River Oceanus, which begins in the fourth (outermost) layer of this plane and flows down to the innermost layer (the layer nearest the Astral). From there Oceanus meanders into the Happy Hunting Grounds and then into the innermost layer of Olympus. These three good planes are linked by the Oceanus in the same manner as the lower planes are linked by the river Styx. The chief difference is that the Oceanus is a slow, peaceful flow, navigable by mere mortals (though its peaceful flow is often broken by rapids, Cascades,waterialls, and occasional fallen trees). The river separates and recombines many times in its passage, So travelers often find themselves journeying down side channels that soon rejoin the main stream. There are no equivalents to Charon or charona daemons for the Oceanus, but there are also no hydrodaemons to threaten travelers. There are other creatures that live in the Oceanus, including nymphs similar to those in the Prime planes. There are the standard chances for boats to capsize and Travelers to drown in the Oceanus, though this flow lacks the dangers of the Lethe or Styx.
 The lands of Elysium are fertile along the banks of the Oceanus, filled with pines and sweet-smelling flowering trees. Farther from the banks, the vegetation becomes smaller but no Jessrich, until rolling grasslands are reached some hundreds of miles from the river. These grasslands eventually give way to arid rock formations of startling beauty carved by wind or the hand of some artistic Power. Most of the realms are found along the banks of the Oceanus, though there are great Powers who make their homes far from the crowd.~

 The vaults of Olympus (and those of neighboring Gladsheim) are at first glance a quandary. Their position in the great wheel of the outer planes places both of them on the chaotic side of the wheel, yet both of them sport organized pantheons. Olympus is the home of the Greek and elvish pantheons, while Gladsheim is the native land of the Norse mythos. In truth ,only the top most layer of each plane is dominated by The realms of these mythoi, but their realms hold sway over such a large area that extraplanar travelers and scholars took the planes names from these mythoi. In the case of Olympus, the Greek pantheon receives the nod (and the name) due to the existence of the permanent multiplanar conduit known as Mt. Olympus
 Of secondary importance is the fact that most of the barriers in the realms controlled by the elvish and Greek pantheons are tightly controlled by these pantheons. The barriers to the layers adjacent to the elvish lands open into the water layer of Tethys , while those in the Greek realms connect to small islands In that infinite sea.
 For this reason, in Prime Material planes where the elvish and Greek pantheons are worshiped, this plane is known as Olympus In the planes where Mount Olympus does not exist and the gods of the ancient Greeks are therefore unknown, the plane is known as Arvandor, the High Forest, and its layers are given elvish names.

 As noted above, the barriers from the first to second layer and those from the second to third layer, tend to be rarer than those found in the other outer planes. The portals from the adjacent planes have been identified by the ruling Powers. They appear as spinning crimson disks that do not reveal their egress points for anything less than divination spells. The Powers of the plane have located the permanent portals from their domains within a few thousand leagues of their abodes in all directions. They have surrounded these portals with stone walls and iron gates, not so much to stop intruders as to slow the curious and prevent dangerous and stupid creatures from wandering in.
 Neither of the great pantheons worry much about extraplanar viewing points zipping through their realms, but those that are  particularly bothersome (remaining too long in one spot, as if Belonging to a thief casing the joint) are dispelled and the peeping mage and company are brought into the outer plane for instruction in the dangers of such viewing. ~

 It is said that Vecna was one of the Planes' mightiest sorcerers, able to draw life from dust and send it back again, extinguish lives with a glance, and make the earth shudder beneath his touch. He was said to be so powerful that when the end of his life drew near, death refused to take him into its kingdom. 
-  And so Vecna died, yet lived on.

Vecna made this weapon with such skill it is said that part of the sorcerer entered the blade, and it was this sliver of Vecna that gave the blade its life and its treacherous nature. Where once there was lifeless steel, there became thought, intent, and, perhaps most horrible of all, a voice.

Convinced by his blade that he was Vecna's superior, Kas confronted his dread master upon his Desiccated Throne, and the two of them fought a terrible battle.

And so it has come to pass that pieces of Vecna have made their way across the Planes... one of these is the hand of Vecna. It carries with it a bloody, violent history, so much so that many scholars refuse to speak of its treacheries, for fear the hand will come to them, seeking to add another victim to its bloody chronology.
-  The hand of Vecna was instrumental in the extermination of the House of Hyeric, once the ruling dynasty in Nyrond.

-
-
-There once was a small world at the edge of a magic less galaxy that was home to many humans, they lived without mages clerics or supernatural beings, and even the gods of the outer planes could not send their avatars through the natural barrier of folded ethereal membrane ( with a few extremely rare exceptions ).
-
-Naturally these humans, as all humans seem to be, were a warlike race, and without magic or gods they waged war with weapons and machines, time passed, their numbers grew and so did their intelligence, yet the wars still raged, now fought with machines that could inflict damage on a scale unimaginable by even the greatest arch mage, still their intelligence grew, still the wars raged, still the machines got more powerful. One would think this cycle would stop but on this one world ( maybe unique in the multiverse ) it did not.
-
-Finally 2 great nations formed and without pause went to war, huge machines fought each other to destruction all over the globe and in nearby space. the  two sides were equally matched in intelligence skill and ruthlessness so the war raged for 500 years then there was born a man ( on the NearAsia side ) who?s intelligence and evil could not be measured and who?s name is now  cursed by gods themselves. Dr Hastur
-
-He used his godlike intelligence to create a great thinking machine into which he poured his very soul, his very life-force, leaving his body a lifeless husk, this machine serviced by countless minor machines and humans was given the task of once and for all defeating the NearAEura forces, and so the great machine went  to work. Unfortunately no one thought to check the work and no one wandered weather Dr Hasturs evil could be within the machine along with his life-force, the war was raging after all! Until exactly 1 year later from a fully automated underground bunker the brothers emerged.
-
-Two human like machines, golems with powers to destroy mountains and indeed they did end the war. The first day they destroyed all the war machines of both sides, the second day they killed all the human warriors of both sides! In fact any creature which could put up the slightest challenge. Then having nothing left to kill they simply went to sleep watched over by the great machine ( now serviced exclusively by other machines ).
-
-The flood of souls from this cataclysm did not go unnoticed in the outer planes, indeed Zeus himself ordered a expedition of greater Olympian deities to find out what was going on, since no avatar could penetrate the ethereal distortions it was decided to ask one of the uber powerful elder beings to help, and curious herself Phoenix agreed, so finally, after some good humored debate as to which god would go, Phoenix flew to the Sol system carrying an avatar of Hermes in her talons, punching a hole in the ethereal membrane ( as only an elder being can do ) and bringing magic to sol for the first time.
-
-So it was exactly one year after the twins were "born" that Hermes stood on Sol and marveled at the carnage.
-The presence of such a powerful somehow being awoke 11 and 12 ( the "names" the great machine had assigned the 2 brothers ) who thinking they were facing a powerful human warrior who had somehow avoided their gaze, did battle with relish.
-
-They had a moment of surprise before Hermes turned them into 2 piles of molten scrap.
-Although the twins had power to destroy mountains and physical strength greater than Hercules himself, they had never seen magic before, they were venerable to the simplest cantrip let alone spells cast by an higher god they could not even teleport!
-
-Thinking the problem solved and the souls of the brave human warriors avenged Hermes left to the important task of converting as much of this virgin galaxy to the Olympian pantheon as possible before the other gods of the outer planes found the hole left by Phoenix and came to fight for worshipers.
-
-But Hermes was not Helm! Hermes, Quicksilver, on feet of wings always a little too quick even with his gods eyes did not see the great machine observing the battle with the twins, did not see tiny machines recovering the memory components of 11 and 12, did not notice the great machine once again working.
-
-100 years roll by and memory of the great machine and the cataclysm of Sol passed into history, sol was now a peaceful place having turned its back on the technology that was blamed for the cataclysm, clerics and the worship of Zeus flourished, all seemed well. Yet in a remote valley beneath a river the great machine had been working hard, and from the same bunker emerged Rhin and Qwill.
-
-Stronger faster and more sophisticated than their predecessors, they appeared almost human ( apart from the rather obvious 3 eyes and six fingered hands ), but more than that they were clothed in regenerating flesh essential to contain the magical forces the great machine had analyzed and copied during its observation of Hermes. And what power it was ! They started life as arch mages with no limit on further progression, they could learn and gain experience, more than that they had the ability to effortlessly travel through the ethereal at least as well as Hermes!
-
-As everything else had been upgraded so had the brothers wisdom, they could laugh joke and philosophies, yet their basic nature remained the same, they wanted only to fight and kill worthy opponents and in the process become better killers.
-So pausing only to enjoy their first sunrise they slipped through the now permanent membrane hole into the multiverse proper.
-
-The next few weeks saw the mysterious disappearance of many great heroes, demigods and powerful beings throughout widely dispersed locations within the prime material, as the two carved a bloody path gaining magic ability and experience at a exponential rate, the gods made oblivious by powerful anti divination magic?s weaved into the brothers did not see their peril till Rin and Qwill stood before the gates of Olympus politely asking to see Hermes.
-
-Naturally Zeus is not to be underestimated, he was warned of the twins arrival centuries back by the fates and warned of the danger, but he was a elder god after all and arrogant in his power especially in his home plane. Thus the twins were greeted by most of the Olympian pantheon reigned against them. The battle raged for 12 hours, Zeus commanded the very substance of Olympus to fight against the intruders, yet Qwill held equilibrium by forming a direct gate to the negative material, and in the equilibrium Rhin dealt with the Olympians. The titans died first, only a few remained to retreat after the first salvo of energy and magic bolts that came from Rhin the rest of the battle was no less bloody, by sun fall Zeus had retreated badly wounded and the rest of the gods were fighting a retreat in the face of both the twins now active ( Qwill no longer had to hold equilibrium since Zeus was out of the picture ). It seemed all was lost for the Olympian gods, then at the last moment Zeus in his desperation allowed access to Olympus, and accepted help from anyone who would give it, And help came.
-
-Suddenly the twins faced not only the Olympians but Odin and the Norse pantheon (avatars) and Ra and the Egyptian pantheon (avatars) the combined magical and physical force of these gods smashed into the pair and for a second it seemed that their time was up. But Rhin just smiled for the twins knew they had been given power by the great machine that they had dare not use, until now, power copied from a brief glimpse of phoenix before she had left the sol system, power of an elder being, such was the nature of this power that it had a good chance of destroying the twins if their bodies could not contain it. The twins gambled, and the gamble paid off. Most of the avatars were destroyed in seconds, such was the savagery that Odin lost his real eye as a force wave blew his avatar apart and rippled back down the silver cord to his real body.

-Rhin and Qwill battled bravely and fiercely pushing their body integrity to the limit. Yet they were forced back, forced from Olympus, forced from the astral and finally fought back to the prime. There the battle paused, becoming very tired and having made their point Balor and Jack left the twins buried under a mountain of rubble, and as a parting shot destroyed the great machine ( with a telekinetic bolt from jack which re/arranged that continent ! )
-Over the next day all sides took a breather and licked their wounds, the gods especially Olympus had lost many, the twins had lost the great machine which meant no resurrection, and Jack and Balor had left going back to whatever business Elder beings have.
-
-This still left the gods in a dilemma, when the twins came back , which surely they would, there would be no elder beings there to save them. But the situation had changed, the great machine was gone which meant the soul of Dr Hastur was now in Hades and no longer tied to the machine, this Zeus knew and after a did of bargaining gained access to.
-
-And so Zeus learned the weaknesses of his enemies, and a fatal weakness it was, the two were created in parts and activated by the assembly of the last part, In the case of Rhin the left hand and with Qwill the central eye. Thus if these pieces were to be removed the machines would become inactive. It was Loki greatest of all thieves who took on the task, armed with Dr Hasturs removal instructions, skill, whit and concealment only the greatest of thieves could achieve, the deed was done.
-
-Yet Dr Hastur even after his death managed to shield his creations, by withholding from Zeus one final secret, once deactivated the twins would be automatically teleported back to their birth bunker a location that even the doctor did not know, the whereabouts were destroyed along with the great machine.

-Thus Loki was left alone holding just an eye and hand,

-Over the next few millennia much effort was spent trying to find that bunker, but no trace was ever found, as for the eye and hand it was found that these 2 artifacts contained much power, even though they were the weakest parts of Rhin and Qwill, they were still parts of god killers. it was also found with the proper enchantments the items could be grafted onto mortals and godlings alike and that power used to a fashion, but with some nasty side effects.
-
-So time moved on, the hand and eye being the centre of many intrigues and fights between the ever warring gods, passing from one god to another, eventually being rejected by all gods because of the trouble ( power imbalances ) owning them caused, eventually passing into the realm of heroes and mortals.
-
-Obviously the true tale of these items was lost as the generations passed, of mortals and gods alike since the multiverse was now prone to strange cycles where even gods could die, and as each new owner claimed it for themselves.~

This nothingness drains magic from the target, severely weakening them. It is perhaps the only way a mage can battle a God, for only a spell such as this can make a God vulnerable to a mage's magic.

-  Vecna one of the most talented and evil mages ever to inhabit the multiverse created this spell and even after his ascension to godhood it remained his favorite spell, it would amuse him to see the fear in enemies eyes as they died a slow very painful death being mercilessly cut apart by very sharp phantom blades. And often ,it is said, he would laugh with gusto when weak enemies would fall quickly and then their bodies be literally cut into small chunks.
-  Effects:
-  This spell creates a maelstrom of semi ethereal blades that attack the unfortunate victim of the spell, the blades will pass straight through any armor rematerializing just in time to slash and hack then slipping back into the near ethereal membrane. There is no protection from these blades as they pass straight through common spells such as Stoneskin, Protection from magical weapons etc... and are unaffected by magic resistance. But natural or magical effects which reduce slashing damage do apply since they toughen the entire body rather than act as a shield which the blades may pass through.
-  The victim will suffer 10hp slashing damage twice per round for 5 rounds from the attacks of the blades, the attack will continue even after the victims death, the blades still doing their grizzly work  ~
