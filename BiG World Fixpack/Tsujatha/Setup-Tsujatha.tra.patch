 @30   = ~Tsujatha Melalor and Lady <CHARNAME> celebrated their nuptials anew when they returned to Amn.

Before he died, however, <CHARNAME> took him in her arms, and they vanished from Toril.  Some claim they went to Arvanaith, others that they went to the Outer Planes.  Their daughter maintained that they returned to Gilalion so that her father could die on the soil of his birth.  Whatever the truth might be, neither <CHARNAME> nor Tsujatha were ever seen again.~
