-@1    = ~Here, take the gold you need, and get yourself and the others away from here, as soon as possible.~
-@2    = ~Do not listen to the babbling of that ignorant wayward child. Here is the money you need, now lead the rest of your men outside, while we keep the Black Talons busy. As for you, <CHARNAME>... I have plenty of things to say about this little quip of yours, and none of them good. Gorion would feel nothing but shame.~
-@3    = ~Thank you, ma'am, thank you very much! I wish you well, and hope that you can bring an end to this stinking operation.~
-@4    = ~Yes, what is it you want? Have you dealt with the druid yet?~
-@5    = ~Err, no, we will be back.~
-@6    = ~We met Voltine. She says it is *you* who scares the girls, and we believe her story. I think you should leave at once, old man.~
-@7    = ~What? What impertinence is this? How foolish you must be to threaten a magic wielder! Never mind... I will dispose of you, if that is what it takes for me to maintain my little... hobby.~
-@8    = ~On behalf of my group, I apologize for the intrusion. I swear on my oath of druidry that intruding on other people's privacy is not a hobby of mine, nor of my companions. Perhaps, to even out this misunderstanding, we could deal with this Gervisse of yours?~
-@9    = ~Hmm, another druid here in the city. How... odd. I suppose you could try speaking with him; I do not see how you could make things worse. I have tried to drive him away, but in return he now spreads ugly rumors about me. If you rid this neighborhood of him, I would be grateful.~
-@10   = ~It appears that we have done a good deed and earned ourselves an ally, <CHARNAME>. Ah, but forgive my manners, Voltine... My name is Jaheira, a druid of Cloakwood. Will you be staying here in the city?~
-@11   = ~I am afraid not, Jaheira. I hear that the bandits of Larswood have been routed... I... fled to the city after it was clear that I would be unable to protect nature from their intrusion. I think it is time for me to return and seek to heal the damage they have done, as well as try and earn redemption in the eyes of the Oak Father.~
-@12   = ~Then I wish you farewell and good luck, sister of the woods.~
-@13   = ~Yes... a graveyard shift. And all because *some* people would not let two little girls fall asleep!~
-@14   = ~Yes, it might not be wise to let her wander around, if only for her own safety. And we shall see if helping her was right, after all. If she proves us wrong... well, then I truly pity her.~
-@15   = ~Save your pity for our foes!~
-@16   = ~I do not feel guilty about killing this fool with his misguided sense of justice, but I am left to question whether saving this drow was a good enough reason for that. Whatever the answer might be, we better dispose of this corpse, lest we earn ourselves more trouble with the Flaming Fist.~
-@17   = ~Your underlings lack... respect for you, rivvin, to speak out of turn... pfft...~
-@18   = ~It is very likely that she possesses a cruel and evil heart, and I suppose that no one will cry for her. But still, I am a little unsettled about the ease with which you took the decision, <CHARNAME>.~
-@19   = ~Hmph. <CHARNAME>, be careful around our new companion. I know her type... do not trust her easily, or, one day, you will find her gone missing, together with our funds. I would normally trust you to make your own judgment, but from the way she was looking at you, I thought a warning would be appropriate.~
-@20   = ~What's your problem, daaarling?~
-@21   = ~Thank you for your kind words, Entillis, but right now I will not have anyone taking care of me. I can stand up for myself... life goes on, and we shall see what comes of it.~
-@22   = ~Entillis! Between your and Khalid's coddling, I really do not need anyone else looking out for me! Must I be made out to be a simpering, helpless waif who needs constant support of the men to survive?~
-@23   = ~My d-dear, I know that you are anything b-but helpless...~
-@24   = ~Wise words, Khalid. Never forget them.~
-@25   = ~It appears my dear friends Khalid and Jaheira are with the Harpers. I am honored and more than a little frightened to find that I warrant such attention. One of their compatriots, a kindly old gent named Entillis Fulsom, seems well-acquainted with my ongoing investigations into the Iron Throne. He has recommended to me the assistance of Scar and Duke Eltan, two men associated with the honorable Flaming Fist Mercenaries, here in Baldur's Gate... Harpers, yet... Sigh, why doesn't anyone ever tell me these things?~
-@26   = ~Nature has been offended here, and the aggressors have been punished severely for their foolishness... Perhaps too severely, but 'tis not for me to judge. Let us leave, <CHARNAME>... let us leave and allow this unfortunate being to die in peace.~
-@27   = ~If you are looking for someone to remove these sirines for you, I suggest you look elsewhere. However, I can understand the resentment... you would do well to understand that it was no act of malice on their part. You can not blame them for something that is their nature.~
-@28   = ~A mage is keeping a nymph enslaved. We should look into this, <CHARNAME>, these are worrying words for me to hear. And be careful for what you wish, woman... once the world were rid of all men, you might realize how much you miss them.~
-@29   = ~A mage is keeping a nymph enslaved. We should look into this, <CHARNAME>, these are worrying words for me to hear. But you are wrong to think that all men are callous brutes, woman. Ah, but I should not boast about my fortune.~
-@30   = ~*blush* Ah, Jaheira... you... you shouldn't have...~
-@31   = ~To help would mean to intrude in the cycle of nature, but... by Silvanus, this is the life of a child we are talking of! I would make an exception in this case, and, I am sure, nature will not protest.~
-@32   = ~Yes, let us follow him, <CHARNAME>... but do not lose sight of him. Once we are outside, I will not hesitate to slay him, and, I trust, you will help.~
-@33   = ~*Neb cackles, but it is impossible to discern if it is because he overheard Jaheira's private words, or simply due to his madness.*~
-@34   = ~Perhaps... when we have more time, we could see what can be done about the fate of this child. It would be wrong to allow her to wander through the streets at night. An orphanage is one option to consider.~
-@35   = ~O, no... they... they won't let me have Angel. And Angel... nobody in the whole world loves me, but my Angel.~
-@36   = ~Be wary, <CHARNAME>. I would suggest freeing this nymph, but not to exchange her for a petty reward... the creature's place is amongst her own kin, in nature. Nymphs have very close affinity with nature, and within the walls of the city, they would perish very swiftly.~
-@37   = ~I have not figured out yet if you truly are evil, or just plain moronic. But it is time to set the speculations aside. Whatever your nature, you were never Gorion's child... and this is where your path ends.~
-@38   = ~We c-can't let this c-creature be enslaved... or worse! J-Jaheira, I am with you!~
-@39   = ~The woodland being will go free.~
-@40   = ~*sigh*~
-@41   = ~Perhaps it is ignorance in your actions more than evil intent, <CHARNAME>... but regardless, I will not let this transaction commence. Silvanus demands you will not take that nymph, mage!~
-@42   = ~I do not agree with our course of action. You would hand over a sentient being in slavery or worse for a few baubles? I suggest you rethink this, before we speak with Ramazith again, for I will not watch idly.~
-@43   = ~I came here expecting to find one of those vile mages who would dissect this beautiful creature looking for spell components. Instead, we find a foolish man with his mind clouded by passion and desire. And while he deserves to be admonished for keeping this nymph here against her will, I suppose it can be understood... we would do well to resolve this without bloodshed, <CHARNAME>.~
-@44   = ~I know not the man, but seeking to capitalize on the misfortune of another surely is despicable. However, the means which this woman is ready to put to use suggest that she is equally wicked. Truth be told, they both disgust me, and I propose we leave them to settle their problems without our interference.~
-@45   = ~To become a pawn of a twisted necromancer with clear intent on upsetting the delicate cycle of nature? Not me, <CHARNAME>, I refuse to trudge through filthy sewers in search for rotten corpses. Every fiber of my being screams in protest at such a suggestion.~
-@46   = ~It is quite reassuring to know that the path you have chosen is approved by Elminster himself. But more importantly, his approval comes with a useful word of advice.~
-@47   = ~Fare thee well.~
-@48   = ~<CHARNAME>! Do you truly wish to anger someone as powerful as Elminster? Do we not have enough enemies? Perhaps his response was slightly... unmerited, but that is no excuse for losing patience so quickly!~
-@49   = ~Ah, <PRO_HESHE> knows not what <PRO_HESHE> is doing.~
-@50   = ~Accompanied by a horde of equally humble baby wyverns? State your purpose here, lest I follow my duty as nature's servant and determine it for myself.~
-@51   = ~That may be so, but they forgot to inform us that our adversary would be a young child. Rest assured, we will return to exchange a few words with them... and perhaps more than simple words.~
-@52   = ~Well, that was an interesting insight. While I agree that these beasts are a part of the great cycle of Nature, it would be foolish to disregard the danger they present. And while they do aerate the soil and improve crop yields, they also reduce the number of farmers managing these lands. They love to reduce the ranks of unsuspecting travelers and adventurers as well... particularly of young and foolish ones.~
-@53   = ~No, and imagine our surprise, when the witch we were supposed to kill turned out to be a mere child. This kind of deception makes me... very angry.~
-@54   = ~<CHARNAME>, you have seen too many of these wicked beasts to believe their lies now. Raise your weapons, and let us rid the world of these foul mockeries of our friends and allies!~
-@55   = ~I know that this must be very hard for you, to keep your temper in check when in the presence of these vile monsters. But you know that it would not be right to pollute these sacred floors with their foul blood. We will make our move against them... but not here and not now.~
-@56   = ~We will surely end up in difficulties with the Watchers for this. And even though I approve of and share the intentions, a library, especially a sacred one as this, is no place for bloodshed.~
-@57   = ~*snicker* I cannot remember ever laughing so hard... little <CHARNAME> and <PRO_HISHER> bearskin rug... I simply must see how our omnipotent authority figure looked, cute as a bug...~
-@58   = ~P-perhaps in exchange I c-could allow <CHARNAME> to take a look at some of the paintings p-portraying you, my d-dear... especially the one I always c-carry with me.~
-@59   = ~*blush* What... what painting, Khalid? I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about, and I suggest we drop this nonsense now. We have more important things to do.~
-@60   = ~*snicker* <CHARNAME>, you owe me for t-this one...~
-@61   = ~I do not relish taking this path, but, unfortunately, it is the only truly safe option. I stand in agreement with your decision, <CHARNAME>.~
-@62   = ~Ya all gonna die!~
-@63   = ~<CHARNAME>, we must not let this wretch get away, he will surely inform his superiors. It would be advisable if we could... prevent this, somehow...~
-@64   = ~Do not dwell, <CHARNAME>. If Elminster won't, then I will tell you more of your foster father. But before we do that, there are things to be done... let us seek out this Tranzig, first. After that, there will be time to talk.~
-@65   = ~I trust thee in this matter, Jaheira, as I trusted Gorion.~
-@66   = ~True, <CHARNAME> has made some dubious decisions in the recent past, but perhaps we would do well not to judge <PRO_HIMHER> so quickly. I am quite confident that I will manage to keep <PRO_HIMHER> on the path of Balance, and by Gorion's memory, it shall be so.~
-@67   = ~Hmm, it would seem that Elminster himself approves of your chosen path. If only he could make the claim that it was his guidance leading you down this path. Alas, he only reserves for himself the right to judge. *sigh*~
-@68   = ~Now, Jaheira, as a druid thou should see that I cannot intervene too closely in matters of... local import. But I trust thee, as I trusted Gorion.~
-@69   = ~Hmm... an odd choice of a reward, as well as an odd choice of words. Both set me ill at ease, to be truthful.~
-@70   = ~Do you always trust so blindly, <CHARNAME>? Could you not see that these men were no thugs, and that we were tricked into killing them? Just to avoid any further mishaps, I should take over the leadership from now on. You have proven to be unfit for the role.~
-@71   = ~Do not listen to the ramblings of a bitter woman, my good <PRO_LADYLORD>. You have done well.~
-@72   = ~For a "thespian extraordinaire", your attempt of conning us into a murder scheme looks extremely dull-witted.~
-@73   = ~Yes, I would have expected such opulence from these Lathanderites in rewarding us, there is splendour and excessiveness in everything they do, 'tis so out of balance... but all in all, at least they appreciate that a good deed has been done.~
-@74   = ~Your help was indeed much appreciated.~
-@75   = ~To accept the help of such a foul abomination of Nature? Have it your way, but be aware that this mindless undead will turn on us as soon as no other prey is in sight.~
-@76   = ~You have obviously been standing in the sun for too long, soldier, as your head has clearly overheated. I suggest that you cease this foolishness, and let us pass. We are expected by the mayor of Nashkel, himself.~
-@77   = ~The mayor of Nashkel himself, eh?~
-@78   = ~*sigh* For all our sakes, I shall hold the party's funds from now on. You... you can have your *gem*, <CHARNAME>.~
-@79   = ~You... you will see the true value of this gem yet!~
-@80   = ~I am more appreciative of the subtle symphonies that see themselves played out in the serenity of a forest grove, but I must admit that I found this young bard's tale to my liking. I swear, compared to those fops that pollute the taverns of Baldur's Gate, this man actually restores the good name to his calling!~
-@81   = ~I hope you remember that tale, Garrick. At our next stop, you will sit and write it down, as I would like to hear it again.~
-@82   = ~Y-yes, ma'am! I sure do remember! Let me see if I can spin my talent and make some improvements to it...~
-@83   = ~By Silvanus, DON'T!~
-@84   = ~M'lady has fine taste.~
-@85   = ~Athkatla? No, thank you very much. I have visited that foul pit and have no intention to return there, not of my own volition.~
-@86   = ~It wasn't t-that bad, d-dear... at least your c-company made the trip worthwhile.~
-@87   = ~Of course you know I would be happy any place with you, Khalid.~
-@88   = ~Oh, it might not be the healthiest place for the likes of you.~
-@89   = ~You must excuse <CHARNAME>'s rudeness, Master Berrun, as it stems from lack of experience as a leader. I think that until <PRO_HESHE> obtains the necessary competency, <CHARNAME> would do better to leave me to handle all our negotiations.~
-@90   = ~Onwards we march then, <CHARNAME>. As this is your first mission, I fear that my skills as a healer will be heavily tested. Nevertheless, I will try to return all of us to Berrun still in one piece and victorious.~
-@91   = ~There is no need for gratitude, Berrun. Helping you was our duty, as you well know. Despite my nagging doubts, <CHARNAME> did well, much better than I expected.~
-@92   = ~Why, <PRO_HESHE> certainly did! Young <CHARNAME> here is a true hero of Nashkel!~
-@93   = ~There is no need for gratitude, Berrun. Helping you was our duty, as you well know. Despite my nagging doubts, <CHARNAME> did well, much better than I expected.~
-@94   = ~*sigh* Stop looking at me like that, <CHARNAME>! Surely, you do not question the loyalty and common sense of *this* druid?~
-@95   = ~You are but a mockery of a druid, woman.~
-@96   = ~Hmph. An offering from one of those filthy Shadow Druids. I am amazed he did not attack us on sight. Still, <CHARNAME>... I would not trust those detestable brews of theirs, that potion should be disposed of instead of consumed.~
-@97   = ~Your companion professed <PRO_HISHER> friendship. Do not test my tolerance.~
-@98   = ~But do you have the strength to carry out this penalty, you wicked fanatic? Does a handful of Shadow Druids have the strength to oppose civilization and shatter it, sending the remains of humankind back in descent to the barbaric state akin to orcs? No, neither you nor your vile comrades have the strength to do so, and ‘tis a lesson you are about to learn.~
-@99   = ~Then I shall die, defending my faith, and return when the Great Mother needs me again.~
-@100  = ~Or is it because of your extremist doctrine, more atrocities against nature are performed, as an act of revenge and retaliation to your cruel misdeeds? You and your blasted kin harm the Great Mother more than the civilization that you seek to oppose; you have done this by antagonizing Nature with one of its most wondrous creations, the humankind. You shall be dealt with swiftly, as will be the animal enslaver. Unlike you, we have the strength and will to oppose him.~
-@101  = ~You will find no slaves here, Jaheira. Only willing warriors, both humans and beasts. But I can see that it is true - you are among those who lie willingly about us. You want to kill me and prove yourself the stronger? Do it, then, but know that by your hand a true defender of nature shall be slain.~
-@102  = ~Ah, the infamous Shadow Archdruid himself, as unbalanced and unreasonable as any of his followers, as one can judge by the way of this greeting. And if the sickle that will try to cut me down is as dull as your wit, then I have very little to fear. <CHARNAME> and I shall clear this wood of the taint of Shadow Druids, so that the *true* druids can resume their caring nurturing of the forest.~
-@103  = ~You are as good at platitudes as your mentor Seniyad.~
-@104  = ~Ah, do not hesitate, little one. <CHARNAME> is surely interested in heroic ventures of the variety you are no doubt about to propose to us. *sigh* If only <PRO_HESHE> would not expect us to be equally as interested...~
-@105  = ~Thank you, madam, for listening.~
-@106  = ~Ah, yes. We trudged all this way to Baldur's Gate in order to steal a... a Tele-whatzit for this foolish little man. Or am I wrong, <CHARNAME>?~
-@107  = ~'Telescope', madam... is such a clumsy word... if you know what I mean... I apologize, if I offended...~
-@108  = ~Yes, suddenly becoming a common thief is indeed "too much fun". Having the Flaming Fist list us as wanted criminals for this burglary, while we are attempting to investigate the situation in the city, will be even more fun, will it not? How did I ever end up with one such as you, <CHARNAME>?~
-@109  = ~You must lead an exciting life, madam.~
-@110  = ~I must say that the generous reward somewhat "balances" out the moral dubiousness of the act itself... *snicker*~
-@111  = ~With all due respect, ma'am... thanks for your help!~
-@112  = ~You... you dare treat such a wonderful gift with such... such callousness... such indifference? Some would give anything to be in your place, but you... you do not even seem to care! Just... just stay away from me, elf, lest I do something we both regret later! No, make that, "lest I do something you will regret later".~
-@113  = ~N-now you've r-really d-done it, Coran. *sigh* B-best to leave her alone, until I th-think of a good way to c-calm her d-down...~
-@114  = ~We will help you, of course. But if I find out that you have been teasing or throwing rocks at the animal... then prepare to face the ire of this protector of Nature. It will be nothing compared to a single bear, that I promise.~
-@115  = ~Where does this cold-hearted mercenary attitude come from, <CHARNAME>? I could understand you asking for gold and riches while doing the bidding of a noble, but the dryad is a pure and innocent sylvan creature that possesses no valuables.~
-@116  = ~If pay I must, I will!~
-@117  = ~To say that I am disappointed is to say nothing at all. If not for my oath to Gorion, I would have given you a good beating for this ruthlessness.~
-@118  = ~I must find help!~
-@119  = ~You knew full well that I would not stand for this, <CHARNAME>! I cannot let you murder this innocent creature! I do not relish breaking my oath to Gorion and raising a weapon against you, but you leave me no choice!~
-@120  = ~It seems that I will have to face you in c-combat, <CHARNAME>, little as I r-relish it, but I c-cannot let you c-c-commit this evil act. I will always stand by Jaheira's side in this.~
-@121  = ~I have mixed feelings about this, <CHARNAME>. On one hand, I detest everything that concerns the vile practice of necromancy... but on the other hand, only a monster could remain unmoved, when facing a plea of a crying child.~
-@122  = ~I must bring Pixie to Daddy!~
-@123  = ~The nereids are dangerous and cunning creatures. I wonder how many sailors this one lured to their deaths... but there is no malice in their intent, it is a part of their nature. Enslaving her by holding the shawl, containing her essence, was a despicable act I am glad we reversed.~
-@124  = ~More than you can imagine, druid... but they died happy...~
-@125  = ~A dragon? Here? Oh, stop being ridiculous. A dragon's presence is always easy to notice, so, I can assure you, there are no dragons hiding in the bowels of this mine. I would prescribe a brief walk in fresh air to clear these delusions.~
-@126  = ~Well, missus, you know better, being an adventurer and all...~
-@127  = ~I swear, the folly of these frightened miners exasperates me to no end. Who could be so dim-witted as to not recognize a common kobold?~
-@128  = ~Then it's a kobold that'll kill me? Whatever...~
-@129  = ~See? A KOBOLD! And they keep me quiet...~
-@130  = ~This girl and I will never get along. She will not be an asset to this group, and will only bring strife and dissent amidst us.~
-@131  = ~You mean that you have the scroll with which to release this petrified woman from her stone prison?~
-@132  = ~Why yes I do! As I said, for mere 500 gold...~
-@133  = ~*THWACK!*~
-@134  = ~OW! You... you hit me! ~
-@135  = ~Glad you noticed. I shall take that scroll, thank you very much. Now get out of here, and quickly, before I have the urge to hit you again. I have little patience for miscreants seeking profit in the misfortune of others.~
-@136  = ~Well... Oookay. I wanted to see myself if that scroll would work...~
-@137  = ~It figures that such a twisted, vile wretch would be spawned from nowhere else but Zhentil Keep... a mad servant to an equally mad god! But worry not, you will not sow strife any longer, dirty Zhent!~
-@138  = ~You will see Cyric's glory when you rejoin the family, my lost sister...~
-@139  = ~No, <PRO_HESHE> is not interested and never will be. Not while I am around, of that you can be sure. Your life is yours to ruin, but do not tempt <CHARNAME> to do the same.~
-@140  = ~What do you... know...~
-@141  = ~Well, it appears that we have finally reached the final hurdle on our path. We have achieved much, already... and you have led us with a competence unexpected at your young age, <CHARNAME>. We all trust in you and know that you will not falter now.~
-@142  = ~*blush* Really, Entillis... did you have to mention that?~
-@143  = ~Oh! Bwahahah! Please, could we have more embarrassing stories of Jaheira's past?~
-@144  = ~Well, as much as I love these family reunions, we really have no time for this.~
-@145  = ~Eh, sad as it is, we also have important business elsewhere... I am sorry, Entillis, but we really must move on. We will meet soon again, I hope.~
-@146  = ~Yes, as much as I love these family reunions, we really have no time for this.~
-@147  = ~I... I feel the curse is dissipating slowly! We are cured of the infection, <CHARNAME>! Praise Silvanus, we have done it!~
-@148  = ~Hmph... strange. I still sense the foul infection within me. Perhaps... perhaps the death of this Selaad is the cure. I hope we will find him before it is too late.~
-@149  = ~<CHARNAME>, do you realize what we have achieved? We have banished a most fearsome and deadly tanar'ri demon back to the planes that spawned it! I feel pride and relief both, for we could have easily been killed in the most gruesome manner by being turned into mindless ghouls... as nature's servant, I find that thought utterly horrifying. But now, Silvanus smiles on us all for what we have done!~
-@150  = ~I care little for the little braggart's missing sword, but it will still serve balance to exact justice on those evil creatures.~
-@151  = ~*groan* And to think that you grew up in a library, surrounded by books of great wisdom and lore... yet cannot recognize even the description of a common gnoll? I only now start to comprehend the job that lies before me...~
-@152  = ~As I expected. At least now we have a good reason to end its unnatural state of existence!~
-@153  = ~I am pleased to once again feel the soothing breath of Mother Nature, as her touch was barely noticeable in the depths of that accursed dungeon. Ah, but why do I complain? We did much good down there, did we not? Looking back at those battles, I marvel at how any of us are able to live and tell the tale, for the opponents we faced there were fierce beyond measure. And we can take much pride in destroying such a foul and unnatural creature as a demon knight, <CHARNAME>.~
-@154  = ~It was a difficult task, but the cause was just, and we succeeded. Your contribution was especially important, Jaheira.~
-@155  = ~As well as it should be, Jaheira! None shall stand in the way of our might, and with the aid of the loot we have captured here, our enemies will fall easily!~
-@156  = ~Silence, woman! What is this "we" you keep mentioning the whole time? Look at me in awe, and bow down before <CHARNAME>, the conqueror of the demon knight!~
-@157  = ~There is wisdom in your words, Jaheira, as always... and the pride and satisfaction of our victory will be excellently conveyed by the poem I am currently composing!~
-@158  = ~A good deed to restore balance to this place, yes, but it was still so distressing being down in that pit. It is so odd that even while closer to Earthmother's heart, her heartbeats were much harder to discern.~
-@159  = ~It is good to know that you find my aid beneficial, <CHARNAME>. There is not much else I can dedicate myself to, other than being useful to the group.~
-@160  = ~'Tis true, we have all grown quite powerful, <CHARNAME>. It gives us a reason to feel good about our chances, though there is hardly any reason to be overconfident. Still, we have done many good deeds together, and I trust we will continue on this path.~
-@161  = ~Hmph. Yes, I have noticed how we all have grown more and more powerful, but the change in you has been the most obvious. It is still not clear how you will use that power, but for the sake of us all, I pray that you do not stray from the path of balance. I hope that you will prove that my caution is unwarranted.~
-@162  = ~It is good that you have chosen this moment to remind us all that despite all the powerful foes we conquered, you have not mastered your own immaturity just yet. Thank you for this reminder, <CHARNAME>.~
-@163  = ~Yes, I thought you would. But be careful not to exaggerate our accomplishments... it would be preferable that the tales of our deeds do not spread too widely. I... I would prefer not to be mentioned at all, though I fear it would be too much to ask from you...~
-@164  = ~That is an interesting observation, child. But I felt much the same as you do, while down there, so it is good to know that your link to Mother Nature is as strong and true as mine. I prayed to the Oak Father to give strength to all of us, but especially to you, for I saw you suffering. I am glad that my prayers were not for naught.~
-@165  = ~No doubt you have heard that the sirines inhabit parts of the coast south of Candlekeep, living in a fortress by the seashore. Though I do not think you have ever come into a conflict with them, if we are to trudge through their territories, it is a likely outcome. Know that their main weapon is the powerful charm spells that twist our minds and make us fight each other. A strategy to prevent this is most welcome, and I have heard of clerics and mages using summons, such as skeletons and ogres, to keep the sirines at bay. Perhaps this option is worth considering.~
-@166  = ~Of course, it may be that you do not plan to defend yourself from those charms, having heard that the beautiful sirines sometimes take male lovers. If that is so, then I will take this opportunity to remind you that the quest to bring Gorion's murderer to justice still requires your attendance...~
-@167  = ~Leave for now, "Koveras"... but we will meet again, I promise as much. And thank these sacred walls of Candlekeep and the presence of the Watchers, else your blood would stain the tiles of the floor, as I speak!~
-@168  = ~I urge you to refuse her offer, <CHARNAME>.~
-@169  = ~I was not planning on letting her join us, Jaheira. Your druidic abilities are more than enough for our group.~
-@170  = ~Jaheira, I trust that your wisdom will convince her to abandon those extremist views. Surely you would be capable of achieving this? Or are you absolutely sure that I should turn her offer down?~
-@171  = ~Bah, we need another healer, and she looks capable. Besides, I am rather fond of the Shadow Druid philosophy...~
-@172  = ~I am glad you think so and have not failed to see the reason.~
-@173  = ~*sigh* Do not bother disguising your meaning, <CHARNAME>, I see past it with ease. Very well, let her join. I shall do my best to get along and mayhap convince her of the folly of her ways, but I will remain cautious. My reward for trying could very well be a sharp bite from this rabid wolf.~
-@174  = ~You are... WHAT? If this is merely a jest to annoy me, then I assure you that it is a very poor one. However, if your words are true, there will be more than one person in our group I will be wary of.~
-@175  = ~<CHARNAME>, this area is rumored to be crowded with basilisks. Their gaze will petrify any of us, unless we protect ourselves with spells or potions. Unless you have such means of protection, I recommend that we return to Beregost. That is, if becoming a lawn ornament is not part of your planning.~
-@176  = ~<CHARNAME>, I know that this part of Cloakwood is heavily infested with ettercaps and spiders. I would advise great caution, as these creatures are not only highly poisonous, but also are known to set devious traps for the unwary. While I possess the knowledge of how to cure the dangerous toxins, having a steady supply of antidote potions is advisable... especially if you insist on more thorough examination of this area.~
-@177  = ~Wait, <CHARNAME>! I see that someone with whom I share the calling of being a druid approaches us. No doubt he will be forthcoming with information about the perils that this part of Larswood Forest holds.~
-@178  = ~Well, <CHARNAME>... excessive use of the henbane is a common oversight by some inexperienced druids, so I hope this will serve as a lesson for all of us. It appears that we are about to receive some answers.~
-@179  = ~We approach the grounds where the Shadow Druids tread. Allow me to tell you more of them, <CHARNAME>. The druidic order normally accepts many different philosophies, and thus, has many different branches... but only one of these branches live waging constant warfare with the others, mostly secret, but on occasion openly. These people, the Shadow Druids, believe that Nature is a cleansing force that must be put to use to fight civilization, that, according to their beliefs, has weakened humankind.~
-@180  = ~Their attempts to encourage people to abandon the attainment of civilization and return to more primitive existence as hunters and gatherers are often carried out with aggression and violence. While they think themselves as caring for Nature and Balance, the means by which they fight for their goals can be cruel and evil, contrary to what the druidic order proposes. They will not let us pass through their territories without interrogation... and as soon as they see me, they might react violently. I count on your support, <CHARNAME>.~
-@181  = ~Hmmm... as I mentioned, I am in quite a hurry, but since you seem so sincerely interested...~
-@182  = ~N-now, d-dear... it wouldn't d-do us any g-good to lose our tempers now, would it? All d-debts will be repaid in t-time, we will both m-make sure of it, t-together... with <CHARNAME>'s help, of course.~
-@183  = ~G-Gorion would be proud of you, <CHARNAME>, for going this far... what c-comes next will put us all in mortal d-danger, and not all of us might return, but... w-we will follow you, hoping for the best.~

+@2    = ~Hört nicht auf das Geplapper dieses ignoranten, missratenen Kindes. Hier ist das Gold, das Ihr braucht, jetzt führt den Rest Eurer Männer nach draußen, während wir die Schwarzkrallen beschäftigen. Und Euch <CHARNAME>... habe ich eine Menge Dinge über Euren kleinen Witz zu sagen, und nichts davon ist gut. Gorion würde nichts fühlen außer Scham.~ 
+@3    = ~Danke, werte Dame, vielen Dank! Ich wünsche Euch alles gute und hoffe, dass Ihr dieser stinkenden Unternehmung ein Ende setzen könnt.~
+@4    = ~Ja, was ist es, dass Ihr wünscht? Habt Ihr die Druidin schon abgefertigt?~ 
+@5    = ~Äh, nein, wir kommen später wieder.~
+@6    = ~Wie haben Voltine getroffen. Sie sagte, dass *Ihr* es seid, der die Mädchen erschreckt, und wir glauben ihrer Geschichte. Ich denke, Ihr solltet sofort verschwinden, alter Mann. ~
+@7    = ~Was? Was für eine Unverfrorenheit ist das? Wie dumm müßte Ihr sein, einem Zauberer zu drohen! Egal... ich werde Euch beseitigen, wenn es das ist, was ich tun muss, um mein kleines .... Hobby weiterzuführen.~ 
+@8    = ~Im Namen meiner Gruppe entschuldige ich mich für meine Einmischung. Ich schwöre bei meinem druidischen Eid, dass das Eindringen in die Privatssphäre der Leute weder ein Hobby von mir, noch von meinen Kamerade ist. Um das Missverständnig auszugleichen, könnten wir vielleicht mit diesem Gervisse, den Ihr erwähntet, verhandeln?~
+@9    = ~Hmm, ein weiterer Druide hier in der Sadt. Wie... komisch. Ich vermute, Ihr könnten versuchen, mit ihm zu reden; ich sehe nicht, wie Ihr die Dinge noch schlechter machen könnt. Ich habe versucht, ihn zu verscheuchen, aber im Gegenzug verbreitet er nun häßliche Gerüchte über mich. Wenn Ihr diese Nachbarschaft von ihm befreien könntet, wäre ich dankbar.~ 
+@10   = ~Es scheint, dass wie eine gute Tat begangen und uns das Vertrauen eines Verbündeten verdient haben, <CHARNAME>. Ah, aber vergebt mir meine Manieren, Voltine... Mein Name ist Jaheira, Druidin des Mantelwaldes. Werdet Ihr in der Stadt bleiben?~
+@11   = ~Ich befürchte nein, Jaheira. Ich höre, dass die Banditen im Larswood besiegt wurden... Ich... bin in die Stadt geflohen, nachdem klar war, dass ich nicht in der Lage wäre, die Natur vor deren Eindringen zu schützen. Ich denke, es ist Zeit für mich, zurück zu kehren und den Schaden, den sie angerichtet haben, zu heilen, ebenso, wie Wiedergutmachung in den Augen des Eichenvater zu ersuchen und zu erlangen.~
+@12   = ~Dann wünsche ich Euch lebe wohl und viel Glück, Schwester des Waldes.~ 
+@13   = ~Ja... eine Nachtschicht. Und all das nur, weil *einige* Leute zwei kleine Mädchen nicht schlafen lassen wollen!~
+@14   = ~Ja, es wäre nicht weise, sie einfach herumlaufen zu lassen, wenn auch nur zu ihrer eigenen Sicherheit. Und schließlich wir werden sehen, ob ihr zu helfen richtig war. Wenn sie uns das Gegenteil beweisen kann, nunja, dann bedauere ich sie aufrichtig.~ 
+@15   = ~Spart Euch Euer Bedauern für unsere Feinde auf!~
+@16   = ~Ich fühle mich für den Tod dieses Dummkopfes, mit seinem fehlgeleiteten Sinn für Gerechtigkeit, nicht schuldig, aber ich frage mich, ob die Rettung dieser Drow ein ausreichend guter Grund dafür war. Wie auch immer die Antwort wäre, wir werden besser diese Leiche los, ansonsten handeln wir uns mehr Ärger mit der Flammenden Faust ein.~

+@18   = ~Es ist sehr wahrscheinlich, dass sie ein grausames und böses Herz hat, und ich vermute, dass niemand um sie weinen wird. Aber dennoch bin ich etwas beunruhig über die Leichtigkeit, mit der Ihr die Entscheidung getroffen habt, <CHARNAME>. ~ 
+@19   = ~Hmph, <CHARNAME>, seid vorsichtig in der Nähe von unsere neuen Gefährtin. Ich kenne diesen Personenkreis... vertraut ihr nicht einfach, oder eines Tages wird sie verschwunden sein - zusammen mit unseren Geldmitteln. Ich würde Euch normalerweise vertrauen, Euer eigenes Urteil zu fällen, aber wegen der Art und Weise wie sie Euch ansah, dachte ich, eine Warnung wäre angebracht.~
+@20   = ~Was ist Euer Problem, Süüße?~ 
+@21   = ~Danke für Eure freundlichen Worte, Entillis, aber jetzt wäre es mir lieber, niemand würde sich um mich kümmern. Ich kann für mich selbst Stellung beziehen... das Leben geht weiter und wir werden sehen, was daraus wird.~ 
+@22   = ~Entillis! Unter Eurem und Khalids Verweichlichen, brauche ich wirklich niemanden sonst, der mich im Auge behält! Bin ich denn ein einfältig lächelndes Straßenkind, das andauernde Unterstützung von Männern braucht, um zu überleben?~
+@23   = ~Mein L-liebes, ich weiß, dass Ihr alles andere a-als hilflos seid...~ 
+@24   = ~Weise Worte Khalid. Vergiß sie niemals.~
+@25   = ~Es scheint, dass meine guten Freunde Khalid und Jaheira Harfner sind. Ich fühle mich geehrt und mehr als ein bischen eingeschüchtert, dass ich solche Aufmerksamkeit benötige. Einer ihrer Landsleute, ein freundlicher, alter Herr namens Entillis Fulsom scheint sehr vertraut mit meinen fortlaufenden Untersuchungen bezüglich des Eisenthrones. Er empfahl mir die Unterstüzung von Scar und Herzog Eltan, zwei Männern die mit den ehrenhaften Flammende Faust Söldnern verbunden sind, hier in Baldurs Tor... 
+Harfner,.. *seufzt*, warum hat mir bloß keiner etwas von diesen Dingen gesagt?~
+@26   = ~Die Natur wurde hier angegriffen und die Angreifer wurden schwer bestraft für ihre Dummheit... Vielleicht zu schwer, aber 's ist nicht an mir, darüber zu urteilen. Laßt uns gehen, <CHARNAME>... laßt uns gehen und diesem bedauernswerten Wesen erlauben, in Frieden zu sterben.~
+@27   = ~Wenn Ihr nach jemandem sucht, der für Euch diese Sirenen entfernt, dann empfehle ich Euch, woanders zu suchen. Wie dem auch sei, ich kann die Feindseligkeit verstehen... Ihr würdet gut beraten sein, zu begreifen, dass es auf ihrer Seite kein Akt der Bösartigkeit war. Ihr könnt sie nicht für etwas verantwortlich machen, was in ihrer Natur liegt. ~
+@28   = ~Ein Zauberer hält eine Nymphe gefangen. Der Sache sollten wir nachgehen, <CHARNAME>, das sind Besorgnis erregede Worte, die ich da höre. Und seid vorsichtig mit dem, was Ihr da wünscht Frau... wäre die Welt von allen Männern "befreit", könntet Ihr feststellen, wie sehr sie Euch fehlen würden.~
+@29   = ~Ein Zauberer hält eine Nymphe gefangen. Der Sache sollten wir nachgehen, <CHARNAME>, das sind Besorgnis erregede Worte, die ich da höre. Aber Ihr liegt falsch damit, zu denken, dass alle Männer herzlose Unmenschen sind, Frau. Ah, aber ich sollte nicht mit meinem Glück angeben.~
+@30   = ~*errötet* Ah, Jaheira... Ihr... ihr solltet nicht...~
+@31   = ~Zu helfen, würde bedeuten, in den Kreislauf des Lebens einzugreifen, aber... bei Sylvanus, es ist das Leben eines Kindes über das wir da reden! Ich würde in diesem Fall eine Ausnahme machen, und ich bin sicher, dass die Natur nichts dagegen haben wird.~
+@32   = ~Ja, laßt uns ihm folgen, <CHARNAME>... aber verliert ihn nicht aus den Augen. Sind wir erstmal außerhalb, werde ich nicht zögern, ihn umzubringen, und ich denke, Ihr werdet mir helfen.~
+@33   = ~*Neb gackert, aber es ist unmöglich zu unterscheiden, ob es daran liegt, dass er Jaheiras privaten Wortwechsel gehört hat, oder ob es einfach seiner Verrücktheit geschuldet ist*~
+@34   = ~Vielleicht... wenn wir etwas mehr Zeit haben, könnten wir über das Schicksal des Kindes nachforschen. Es wäre falsch, sie nachts die Straßen entlang laufen zu lassen. Ein Waisenhaus wäre eine in Betracht zu ziehende Option.~
+@35   = ~O, nein... sie... sie werden mich Engel nicht haben lassen. Und Engel... niemand auf der ganzen Welt liebt mich, außer Engel.~
+@36   = ~Seid vorsichtig, <CHARNAME>. Ich würde vorschlagen, diese Nymphe zu befreien, aber nicht, sie für eine belanglose Belohnung einzutauschen... der Platz dieses Gesschöpfes ist unter ihresgleichen, in der Natur. Nymphen haben eine sehr enge Verbundenheit mit der Natur, und innerhalb dieser Wände in der Stadt würde sie sehr schnell eingehen.~
+@37   = ~Ich habe noch nicht heraus gefunden, ob Ihr wirklich böse seid oder einfach nur schwachsinnig. Aber es ist Zeit, den Spekulationen ein Ende zu setzen. Was auch immer Eure Natur ist, Ihr ward niemals Gorions Kind... und das ist, wo Euer Weg endet.~
+@38   = ~Wir k-können dieses G-geschöpf nicht eingesperrt lassen... oder schlimmeres! J-jaheira, ich bin an Eurer Seite!~
+@39   = ~Das Waldwesen wird freigelassen.~
+@40   = ~*seufzt*~
+@41   = ~Vielleicht liegt eher Ignoranz in Eurem Handeln als böse Absicht, <CHARNAME>... aber trotzdem werde ich diesen Handel nicht zulassen. Sylvanus verlangt, dass Ihr diese Nymphe nicht bekommt, Zauberer!~
+@42   = ~Ich bin mit unserem Handeln nicht einverstanden. Ihr würdet dieses fühlende Wesen der Sklaverei oder schlimmerem überlassen für ein paar Weihnachtskugeln? Ich schlage vor, Ihr überdenkt das noch einmal, bevor wir wieder mit Ramazith sprechen, denn ich werde dabei nicht tatenlos zusehen.~
+@43   = ~Ich kam hier her und habe einen dieser niederträchtigen Zauberer erwartet, der diese wundervolle Kreatur sezieren würde, um nach Zauberspruch-Bestandteilen zu suchen. Stattdessen finden wir einen dummen Mann, dessen Geist durch Leidenschaft und Verlangen getrübt ist. Und während er es verdient, wegen des Festhaltens der Nymphe an diesem Ort gegen ihren Willen, ermahnt zu werden, kann es, wie ich vermute, versanden werden... wir würden gut daran tun, das ohne Blutvergießen zu lösen, <CHARNAME>.~
+@44   = ~Ich kenne den Mann nicht, aber zu versuchen, Kapital aus dem Unglück eines anderen zu schlagen, ist verabscheuungswürdig. Wie auch immer, die Methode, die diese Frau bereitwillig empfiehlt, läßt vermuten, dass sie gleichermaßen niederträchtig ist. Ehrlich gesagt, beide widern mich an und ich schlage vor, wir lassen sie ihre Probleme selber lösen, ohne unser Eingreifen.~
+@45   = ~Eine Schachfigur von einem verdrehten Nekromanten werden, mit klarer Absicht, den empfindlichen Kreislauf der Natur durcheinander zu bringen? Nicht mit mir, <CHARNAME>, ich lehne es ab, durch die dreckige Kanalisation zu trotten, um Leichen zu suchen. Jede Faser meines Körpers sträubt sich bei solch einem Vorschlag.~
+@46   = ~Es ist ziemlich beruhigend, zu wissen, dass der Weg, den Ihr eingeschlagen habt, von Elminster höchstselbst befürwortet wird. Aber noch wichtiger, seine Zustimmung ist gepaart mit einem nützlichen Ratschlag.~
+@47   = ~Lebt wohl.~
+@48   = ~<CHARNAME>! Wollt Ihr wirklich jemanden so mächtigen wie Elminster verärgern? Haben wir nicht schon genug Feinde? Vielleicht war seine Antwort ein wenig... unverdient, aber das ist keine Entschuldigung dafür, so schnell die Geduld zu verlieren!~
+@49   = ~Ah, <PRO_ERSIE> weiß nicht, was <PRO_ERSIE> macht.~
+@50   = ~Begleitet von einer Gruppe gleichsam demütiger Lindwurm-Jungtiere? Erklärt Euren Zweck hier, ansonsten folge ich meiner Pflicht als Diener der Natur und entscheide es selbst.~
+@51   = ~Das mag so sein, aber sie haben vergessen uns mitzuteilen, dass unser Gegner ein Kind ist. Seid versichert, wir werden zurückkehren und ein paar Worte mit ihnen austauschen... und vielleicht auch mehr als nur einfache Worte.~
+@52   = ~Also das war ein interessanter Einblick. Während ich zustimme, dass diese Biester ein Teil des großen Kreislauf der Natur sind, wäre es dumm, die Gefahr, die sie darstellen, zu missachten. Und während sie den Boden auflockern und die Ernteerträge erhöhen, reduzieren sie ebenfalls die Anzahl der Bauern, die diese Flächen bewirtschaften. Sie mögen es die Anzahl von ahnungslosen Reisenden zu reduzieren, ebenso wie Abenteurer... besonders die jungen und unerfahrenen.~
+@53   = ~Nein und stellt Euch unsere Überraschung vor, als sich herausstellte, dass die Hexe, die wir töten sollten, bloß ein Kind war. Diese Art von Täuschung macht mich... äußerst wütend.~
+@54   = ~<CHARNAME>, Ihr habt schon zu viele dieser niederträchtigen Biester gesehen, um nun ihren Lügen zu glauben. Erhebt Eure Waffen und lasst uns die Welt von diesen widerlichen Verhöhnungen unserer Freunde und Gefährten säubern!~
+@55   = ~Ich weiß, dass das sehr schwer für Euch sein muss, Euren Zorn unter Kontrolle zu halten in der Gegenwart dieser abscheulichen Monster. Aber Ihr wisst, dass es nicht richig wäre, diesen heiligen Boden mit ihrem Blut zu verschmutzen. Wir werden unseren Zug gegen sie machen... aber nicht hier und jetzt.~
+@56   = ~Wir werden dafür sicherlich mit den Wächtern Schwierigkeiten bekommen. Und obwohl ich die Absichten unterstütze und teile, ist eine Bibliothek, besonders eine geheiligte wie diese, kein Ort für Blutvergießen.~
+@57   = ~*kicher* Ich kann mich nicht erinnern, jemals so gelacht zu haben... Klein-<CHARNAME> und <PRO_SEINIHR> Bärenfellläufer... Ich muss einfach wissen, wie unsere allgegenwärtige Autoritätsperson ausgesehen hat, als <PRO_HESHE> wirklich ganz niedlich war...~
+@58   = ~V-vielleicht k-könnte ich im Austausch <CHARNAME> erlauben, einen Blick auf einige der G-gemälde zu werfen, die Dich p-portraitieren, mein Liebes... besonders das eine, das ich immer bei mir t-trage.~
+@59   = ~*errötet* Welches... welches Gemälde, Khalid? Ich habe absolut keine Ahnung, wovon Ihr sprecht und ich schlage vor, wir beenden diesen Unsinn jetzt. Wir haben wichtigere Dinge zu erledigen.~
+@60   = ~*kicher* <CHARNAME>, Ihr schuldet mir was d-dafür...~
+@61   = ~Ich genieße es nicht, diesen Weg gewählt zu haben, aber leider ist es die einzig sichere Option. Ich stimme Eurer Entscheidung zu, <CHARNAME>.~
+@62   = ~Ihr werdet alle sterben!~
+@63   = ~<CHARNAME>, wir dürfen diesen Mistkerl nicht davon kommen lassen, er wird sicher seine Vorgesetzten informieren. Es wäre angeraten, wenn wir das... verhindern könnten, irgendwie...~
+@64   = ~Haltet Euch nicht auf, <CHARNAME>. Wenn Elminster es nicht wird, dann werde ich Euch mehr über Euren Ziehvater erzählen. Aber bevor wir das können, müssen Dnge erledigt werden... lasst uns erst diesen Tranzig suchen. Danach wird Zeit sein, um zu reden.~
+@65   = ~Ich vertraue Euch in dieser Sache, Jaheira, so wie ich Gorion vertraute.~
+@66   = ~Wohl wahr, <CHARNAME> hat einige zweifelhafte Entscheidungen in der jüngsten Vergangenheit getroffen, aber vielleicht täten wir gut daran, nicht so schnell über  <PRO_IHNSIE> zu urteilen. Ich bin ziemlich überzeugt, dass ich es schaffen werde <PRO_IHNSIE> auf dem Pfad des Gleichgewichts zu halten und bei der Erinnerung an Gorion, so soll es sein.~
+@67   = ~Hm, es scheint, dass Elminster höchstselbst Eurem gewählten Pfad zustimmt. Wenn er nur Anspruch darauf erheben würde, dass es seine Führung war, die Euch diesen Weg einschlagen ließ. Leider reserviert er einzig sich das Recht, darüber zu urteilen. *seufzt*~
+@68   = ~Nun, Jaheira, als Druide sollte Ihr insbesondere erkennen, dass ich mich nicht zu deutlich in Angelegenheiten von... regionaler Bedeutung einmischen darf. Aber ich vertraue Euch, wie ich Gorion vertraut habe.~
+@69   = ~Hmm... eine setlsame Wahl für eine Belohnung, ebenso wie eine merkwürdige Wahl der Worte. Beides versetzt mich in Unbehagen, um ehrlich zu sein.~
+@70   = ~Vertraut Ihr immer so blind, <CHARNAME>? Konntet Ihr nicht erkennen, dass diese Männer keine Schläger waren und dass wir hereingelegt wurden, sie zu töten? Nur um weitere Unfälle zu vermeiden, sollte ich von jetzt an die Führung übernehmen. Ihr habt bewiesen, dieser Rolle nicht gewachsen zu sein.~
+@71   = ~Hört nicht auf dieses Gelaber einer verbitterten Frau, <PRO_FRAUHERR>. Das habt Ihr gut gemacht.~
+@72   = ~Für einen "Meister der Theaterkunst", scheint Euer Versuch, uns in ein Mordkomplott zu steuern, extrem stumpfsinnig.~
+@73   = ~Ja, ich hätte solchen Überfluss bezüglich unserer Entlohnung von diesen Lathanderanhängern erwarten sollen, es liegt Prunk und Übermaß in allem, was sie tun, 's ist so unverhältnismäßig... aber immerhin, zumindetst honorieren sie, dass eine gute Tat verrichtet wurde.~
+@74   = ~Eure Hilfe wurde in der Tat sehr geschätzt.~
+@75   = ~Die Hilfe solch einer verdorbenen Abscheulichkeit der Natur zu akzeptieren? Macht, was Ihr wollt, aber seid Euch dessen bewußt, dass sich dieser geistlose Untote uns zuwendet, sobald keine andere Beute in Sicht ist.~
+@76   = ~Ihr habt offensichtlich viel zu lange in der Sonne gestanden, Soldat, da Euer Kopf eindeutig überhitzt ist. Ich schlage vor, dass Ihr Eure Dummheiten sein  und uns passieren lasst. Wir werden vom Bürgermeister von Nashkel persönlich erwartet.~
+@77   = ~Der Bürgermeister von Nashkel höchstselbst, was?~
+@78   = ~*seutzt* Um unseretwillen sollte ich von jetzt an die Geldmittel verwalten. Ihr... Ihr könnt Euren *Edelstein* haben, <CHARNAME>.~
+@79   = ~Ihr... Ihr werdet den wahren Wert dieses Edelsteins schon noch sehen!~
+@80   = ~Ich bin empfänglicher für die feinen Sinfonien die in der Gelassenheit eines Waldes aus sich selbst heraus entstehen, aber ich muss zugeben, dass mir die Geschichte des jungen Barden gefällt. Ich schwöre, verglichen mit diesen Lackaffen, die die Tavernen von Baldurs Tor verschmutzen, stellt dieser Mann genau genommen den guten Namen seiner Berufung wieder her!~
+@81   = ~Ich hoffe, Ihr erinnert Euch an diese Geschichte, Garrick. Bei unserer nächsten Rast, werdet Ihr Euch hinsetzten und sie niederschreiben, denn ich möchte sie noch einmal hören.~
+@82   = ~J-ja, gnä' Frau! Mit Sicherheit erinnere ich mich! Lasst mich versuchen, mein Talent anzukurbeln und einige Verbesserungen an ihr vorzunehmen...~
+@83   = ~Bei Sylvanus, NEIN!~
+@84   = ~Gnä' Frau haben einen feinen Geschmack.~
+@85   = ~Athkatla? Nein, danke vielmals. Ich habe diese faule Grube besucht und ich haben keinen Drang dorthin zurück zu kehren, nicht aus eigenem Willen.~
+@86   = ~Es war nicht s-so schlecht, L-liebes... zumindest Eure B-begleitung machte die Reise lohnenswert.~
+@87   = ~Aber selbstverständlich wißt Ihr, dass ich überall mit Euch glücklich wäre, Khalid.~
+@88   = ~Oh, es könnte nicht der gesündeste Ort sein für Leute wie Euch.~
+@89   = ~Ihr müsst <CHARNAME<'s Unhöflichkeit entschuldigen, Meister Berrun, sie stammt von einem Mangel an Erfahrung als Anführer. Ich denke, dass <CHARNAME> gut beraten wäre, mich all unsere Verhandlungen führen zu lassen, bis <PRO_ERSIE> die nötige Kompetenz erworben hat.~
+@90   = ~Na dann weiter geht's, <CHARNAME>. Da das Eure erste Mission ist, fürchte ich, dass meine Fähigkeiten als Heiler auf eine harte Probe gestellt werden. 
+Nichtsdestotrotz werde ich versuchen, alle von uns in einem Stück und siegreich zu Berrun zurück zu bringen.~
+@91   = ~Es gibt keinen Grund für solche Dankbarkeit, Berrun. Zu helfen war unsere Pflicht, wie Ihr wohl wisst. Trotz meiner bohrenden Zweifel, hat <CHARNAME> es gut gemacht, viel besser, als ich erwartet habe.~
+@92   = ~Aber sicherlich hat <PRO_ERSIE> das! Jungspund <CHARNAME> hier ist ein echter Held von Nashkel!~
+@93   = ~Es gibt keinen Grund für solche Dankbarkeit, Berrun. Zu helfen war unsere Pflicht, wie Ihr wohl wisst. Trotz meiner bohrenden Zweifel, hat <CHARNAME> es gut gemacht, viel besser, als ich erwartet habe.~
+@94   = ~*seufzt* Hört auf, mich so anzusehen, <CHARNAME>! Sicherlich stellt Ihr weder die Loyalität noch den Verstand *dieses* Druiden in Frage?~
+@95   = ~Ihr seid nur eine Verspottung eines Druide, Weib.~
+@96   = ~Hmph. Eine Gabe von einem dieser dreckigen Schatten - Druiden. Ich bin erstaunt, dass er uns nicht augenblicklich angegriffen hat. Dennoch, <CHARNAME>... ich würde diesen gäulichen Gebräuen von denen nicht trauen, dieser Trank sollte entsorgt werden, statt konsumiert.~
+@97   = ~Euer Gefährte erklärte <PRO_IHMIHR> die Freundschaft. Testet nicht meine Toleranz.~
+@98   = ~Aber habt Ihr auch die Stärke, diese Strafen zu vollziehen, Ihr bösartigen Fanatiker? Hat eine Handvoll Schatten-Druiden die Macht, sich der Zivilisation entgegen zu stellen und sie zu zerschmettern, die Überbleibsel der Menschheit zurückzuwerfen zu den Anfänge des barbarischen Zustandes ähnlich den Orks? Nein, weder Ihr noch Eure niederträchtigen Kameraden habt die Kraft, das zu tun, und 's ist eine Lektion, die Ihr gerade erfahren werdet.~
+@99   = ~Dann werde ich, meinen Glauben verteidigend, sterben und zurück kehren, wenn die Große Mutter mich wieder benötigt.~
+@100  = ~Oder liegt es an Euren extremen Lehren, dass mehr Gräueltaten gegen die Natur ausgeführt werden, als ein Akt der Rachen und Vergeltung Eurer grausamen Missetaten? Ihr und Eure verfluchte Art verletzten die Große Mutter mehr, als die Zivilisation, gegen die Ihr ablehnt; Ihr habt der Natur entgegen gewirkt an einer ihrer wunderbarsten Kreationen, der Menschheit. Mit Euch sollte kurzer Prozess gemacht werden, ebenso wird es mit den Tiergehegen geschehen. Anders als Ihr, haben wir die Kraft und den Willen, uns ihm entgegen zu stellen.~
+@101  = ~Ihr werdet hier keine Sklaven finden, Jaheira. Nur bereitwillige Krieger, sowohl Menschen als auch Tiere. Aber ich kann erkennen, dass es wahr ist - Ihr befindet Euch unter jenen, die bereitwillig Lügen über uns verbreiten. Ihr wollt mich töten und Euch beweisen, dass Ihr stärker seid? Dann tut es, aber wisset, dass durch Eure Hand ein wahrer Verteidiger der Natur getötet wird.~
+@102  = ~Ah, der berüchtigte Schatten-Erzdruide höchstselbst, genauso unausgeglichen und unvernünftig wie all seine Anhänger, wie man anhand seiner Art der Begrüßung urteilen kann. Und wenn die Sichel, die versuchen wird mich abzumähen, genauso stumpf ist wie Euer Verstand, dann hab ich wenig zu fürchten. <CHARNAME> und ich werden diesen Wald vom Makel der Schatten-Druiden säubern, auf dass die *echten* Druiden ihre mitfühlende Pflege dieser Wälder fortsetzen können.~
+@103  = ~Ihr seid genauso gut mit hohlen Phrasen wie Euer Mentor Seniyad.~
+@104  = ~Ah, zögert nicht Kleiner. <CHARNAME> ist sicherlich interessiert an heldenhaften Unternehmungen dieser Art, die Ihr uns zweifelsohne vorschlagen wollt. *seufzt* Wenn nur <PRO_ERSIE> nicht erwarten würde, dass wir ebenso daran interessiert sind... ~
+@105  = ~Danke, meine Dame, für's Zuhören.~
+@106  = ~Ah, ja. Wir schleppen uns all den ganzen Weg nach Baldurs Tor, um ein... ein Tele-wasfür'nding für diesen närrischen Kleinen Mann zu stehlen. Oder liege ich da falsch, <CHARNAME>?~
+@107  = ~'Teleskope' werte Dame... ist so ein plumpes Wort... wenn Ihr versteht, was ich meine... Ich entschuldige mich, wenn ich Euch beleidigt habe...~
+@108  = ~Ja, plötzlich ein gemeiner Dieb zu werden, ist in der Tat "zu viel Spaß". Auf der Schwarzen Liste der Flammenden Faust als gesuchte Kriminelle zu stehen, während wir versuchen, die Situation in der Stadt zu untersuchen, wird sogar noch sehr viel lustiger sein, nicht wahr? Wie konnte ich nur zusammen mit jemandem wie Euch enden, <CHARNAME>?~
+@109  = ~Ihr müßt ein aufregendes Leben führen, werte Dame.~
+@110  = ~Ich muss sagen, dass die großzügige Belohnung, die moralische Fragwürdigkeit dieses Aktes einigermaßen "ausgleicht"... *kicher*~
+@111  = ~Mit allem nötigen Respekt, gnä' Frau... danke für Eure Hilfe!~
+@112  = ~Ihr... Ihr wagt es, solch ein wunderbares Geschenkt mit solcher... solcher Gefühllosigkeit... solcher Gleichgültigkeit zu behandeln? Einige würden alles geben, an Eurer Stelle zu sein, aber Euch... Euch scheint das völlig egal zu sein! Bleibt... bleibt bloß weg von mir Elf, sonst tue ich noch etwas, dass wir beide später bereuen! Nein, besser wäre, " sonst tue ich etwas, dass Ihr später bereuen werdet".~
+@113  = ~J-jetzt habt Ihr es w-wirklich g-geschafft, Coran. *seufzt* Laßt sie b-besser allein, bis ich einen guten Weg g-gefunden habe, sie zu b-beruhigen...~
+@114  = ~Natürlich werden wir Euch helfen. Aber wenn ich herausfinde, dass Ihr das Tier geärgert habt oder Steine nach ihm geworfen habt... dann bereitet Euch darauf vor, dem Zorn dieses Bewahrers der Natur gegenüber zu treten. Das wird nichts im Vergleich mit einem einzelnen Bären sein, das verspreche ich.~
+@115  = ~Woher kommt diese kalt-herzige Söldner-Einstellung, <CHARNAME>? Ich könnte verstehen, wenn Ihr nach Gold und Reichtümern fragt, während Ihr dem Angebot eines Edelmannes nachkommt, aber die Dryade ist eine reine und unschuldige Kreatur, die keine Wertsachen besitzt.~
+@116  = ~Wenn ich zahlen muss, dann werde ich das!~
+@117  = ~Zu sagen,dass ich enttäuscht bin, ist rein gar nichts zu sagen. Wenn es nicht wegen meines Eides Gorion gegenüber, hätte ich Euch eine ordentliche Abreibung verpasst für solch eine Rücksichtslosigkeit.~
+@118  = ~Ich muss Hilfe finden!~
+@119  = ~Ich wußtet sehr wohl, dass ich dafür nicht einstehen würde, <CHARNAME>! Ich kann Euch dieses unschuldige Geschöpf nicht töten lassen! Ich finde keinen Gefallen daran, den Eid Gorion gegenüber zu brechen und eine Waffe gegen Euch zu erheben, aber Ihr lasst mir keine Wahl!~
+@120  = ~Es scheint, dass ich Euch im K-kampf gegenübertreten muss, <CHARNAME>, so wenig Vergnügen m-mir das auch bereitet, aber ich kann Euch diese böse Tat nicht b-begehen lassen .  Ich werde hierbei immer a-auf Jaheiras Seite stehen.~
+@121  = ~Ich habe in dieser Angelegenheit gemischte Gefühle, <CHARNAME>. Einerseits verabscheue ich all das, was die üble Ausführung von Totenbeschwörung betrifft... aber andererseits würde nur ein Monster unbewegt bleiben, wenn es mit solch einer Bitte eines weinenden Kindes konfrontiert wäre.~
+@122  = ~Ich muss Pixie zu Pappi bringen!~
+@123  = ~Die Wassernymphen sind gefährliche und gerissene Kreaturen. Ich frage mich, wie viele Seefahrer diese hier in ihren Tod gelockt hat... aber es liegt keine Bösartigkeit in ihrer Absicht, es ist Teil ihrer Natur. Sie zu versklaven, indem man ihr Halstuch, das ihre Essenz enthält, innehat, ist ein verachtenswerter Akt, und ihn zu revidieren, bin ich froh.~
+@124  = ~Mehr als Ihr Euch vorstellen könnt, Druidin... aber sie starben glücklich...~
+@125  = ~Ein Drache? Hier? Oh, macht Euch nicht lächerlich. Die Gegenwart eines Drachen ist leicht zu bemerken, ich kann Euch versichern, es verstecken sich keine Drachen im Inneren der Mine. Ich würde einen kürzen Spaziergang an der frischen Luft anordnen, um diese Einbildungen zu löschen.~
+@126  = ~Nunja, Fräulein, Ihr wisst es besser, da Ihr ein Abenteurer seid und all das...~
+@127  = ~Ich schwöre, die Torheit dieser verängstigten Minenarbeiter ärgert mich maßlos. Wer könnte so unterbelichtet sein, und einen gemeinen Kobold nicht erkennen?~
+@128  = ~Dann ist es ein Kobold, der mich töten will? Was auch immer...~
+@129  = ~Seht Ihr? EIN KOBOLD! Und sie wollen, dass ich still bin...~
+@130  = ~Dieses Mädchen und ich werden niemals miteinander auskommen. Sie wird der Gruppe nichts nützen und nur Streit und Unstimmigkeit unter uns hervorrufen.~
+@131  = ~Ihr meint, Ihr habt eine Schriftrolle bei Euch, um diese versteinerte Frau aus ihrem Steingefängnis zu entlassen?~
+@132  = ~Ja, mache ich! Wie ich sagt, für nur 500 Goldstücke...~
+@133  = ~*RUMS!*~
+@134  = ~OW! Ihr... Ihr habt mich geschlagen!~
+@135  = ~Fein, dass Ihr das bemerkt habt. Ich werde die Schriftrollen nehmen, vielen Dank. Jetzt verschwindet, rasch, bevor ich den Drang verspüre, Euch noch einmal zu schlagen. Ich habe wenig Geduld für Übeltäter, die versuchen, Profit aus dem Unglück anderer zu ziehen.~
+@136  = ~Oh... oookay. Ich würde gerne selbst sehen, ob die Spruchrolle wirkt...~
+@137  = ~Ich vermute, so ein verdrehter, böser Kerl kann von nirgendwo sonst als aus der Zhentarim Feste herkommen... ein verrückter Diener einer ebenso verrückten Gottheit! Aber keine Sorge, Ihr werdet nicht länger Streit säen, dreckiger Zhentarim!~
+@138  = ~Ihr werdet Cyrics Herrlichkeit erkennen, wenn Ihr in die Familie zurückkehrt, meine verlorene Schwester...~
+@139  = ~Nein, <PRO_ERSIE> ist nicht daran interessiert und wird es auch nie sein. Nicht solange ich dabei bin, da könnt Ihr sicher sein. Euer Leben zu ruinieren, ist Eure Sache, aber führt nicht <CHANAME> in Versuchung, das gleich zu tun.~
+@140  = ~Was wisst... Ihr denn...~
+@141  = ~Also, es scheint, dass wir die letzte Hürde auf unserem Pfad endlich erreicht haben. Wir haben schon eine Menge erreicht... und Ihr habt uns mit großer Kompetenz geführt, was unerwartet war angesichts Eures jungen Alters, <CHARNAME>. Wir alle vertrauen Euch und wissen, dass Ihr jetzt nicht straucheln werdet.~
+@142  = ~*errötet* Wirklich, Entillis... musstet Ihr das erwähnen?~
+@143  = ~Oh! Bwahahah! Bitte, können wir mehr peinliche Geschichten aus Jaheiras Vergangenheit hören?~
+@144  = ~Nunja, so sehr ich diese Familientreffen auch mag, wir haben wirklich keine Zeit dafür.~
+@145  = ~Eh, so traurig es ist, aber auch wir haben wichtige Dinger anderswo zu erledigen... tut mir leid, Entillis, aber wir müssen jetzt wirklich weiter. Ich hoffe, wir treffen uns bald wieder.~
+@146  = ~Ja, so sehr ich diese Familientreffen auch mag, wir haben wirklich keine Zeit dafür.~
+@147  = ~Ich... ich fühle, dass der Fluch langsam vergeht! Wir sind von der Infektion genesen, <CHARNAME>! Gepriesen sei Sylvanus, wir haben es geschafft!~
+@148  = ~Hmph... seltsam. Ich kann die üble Infektion immernoch in mir spüren. Vielleicht... vielleicht bringt der Tod von diesem Selaad die Heilung. Ich hoffe, wir finden ihn, bevor es zu spät ist. ~
+@149  = ~<CHARNAME>, begreift Ihr, was wir geschafft haben? Wir haben einen furchterregenden und tödlichen Tanar'ri verbannt und zurück geschickt in die Ebenen, aus denen er kam! Ich fühle beides, Stolz und Erleichterung, denn wir hätte leicht getötet werden können, durch das grausame Umwandeln in geistlose Ghule... als Diener der Natur, finde ich diesen Gedanken absolut erschreckend. Aber jetzt lächelt Sylvanus, ob allem was wir getan haben, auf uns herab!~
+@150  = ~Das verlorene Schwert des kleinen Angebers kümmert mich nicht, aber es dient dem Gleichgewicht, Gerechtigkeit an solch bösen Wesen auszuführen.~
+@151  = ~*stöhnt* Da denkt man, Ihr seid in einer Bibliothek aufgewachsen, umgeben von Büchern mit herausragender Weisheit und Wissen... und doch könnt Ihr keine Beschreibung eines gemeinen Gnolls erkennen? Ich fange gerade an, die Aufgabe, die vor mir liegt, zu begreifen...~
+@152  = ~Wie ich erwartet habe. Zumindest haben nun einen guten Grund, seine unnatürliche Existenz zu beenden!.~
+@153  = ~Es freut mich, erneut den wohltuenden Atem von Mutter Natur zu spüren, da ihre Berührung in den Tiefen des verfluchten Kerkers kaum merklich war. Ah, aber warum beschwere ich mich? Wir haben eine Menge gutes getan dort unten, nicht wahr? Wenn ich an die Kämpfe zurück denke, dann wundere ich, wie jeder von uns das überleben und die Geschichte darüber erzählen konnte, denn die Gegner auf die wir trafen waren unmessbar böse. Und wir können ziemlich stolz darauf sein, so eine üble und widernatürliche Kreatur wie einen Dämonenritter zerstört zu haben, <CHARNAME>.~
+@154  = ~Es war eine schrierige Aufgaben, aber der Grund war gerecht und wir waren erfolgreich. Euer Beitrag war ganz besonders wichtig, Jaheira.~
+@155  = ~Genauso wie es sein sollte, Jaheira! Niemand sollte sich in den Weg unserer Macht stellen, und mit Hilfe der Beute, die wir gemacht haben, werden unsere Gegner noch einfacher fallen!~
+@156  = ~Schweig, Frau! Was soll dieses "wir", dass Ihr die ganze Zeit erwähnt? Betrachtet mich mit Ehrfurcht und kniet nieder vor <CHARNAME>, dem Bezwinger des Dämonenritters!~
+@157  = ~da ist Weisheit in Euren Worten, Jaheira, wie immer... und der Stolz und die Zufriedenheit unseres Sieges wird durch dieses Gedicht, das ich gerade schreibe, ausgezeichnet transportiert werden!~
+@158  = ~Ein guter Dienst, das Gleichgewicht an jenem Ort wieder herzustellen, ja, aber es war dennoch quälend dort unten in der Grube. Es ist schon komisch, während man näher am Herz der Erdenmutter war, war ihr Herzschlag sehr viel schwieriger wahrzunehmen.~
+@159  = ~Es ist gut zu wissen, dass Ihr meine Unterstützung als hilfrreich empfunden habt, <CHARNAME>. Es gibt nicht viel anderes, dem ich mich hingebe, außer nützlich für die Gruppe zu sein.~
+@160  = ~'s ist wahr, wir sind alle ziemlich stark geworden, <CHARNAME>. Das gibt uns einen Grund, uns gut ob unserer Aussichten zu fühlen, aber das ist wohl kaum ein Grund, vermessen zu werden. Doch wir haben eine Mange guter Dinge zusammen getan, und ich vertraue darauf, dass wir auf diesem Weg so weiter machen.~
+@161  = ~Hmph. Ja, ich habe mitbekommen, wie wir alle mehr und mehr stärker wurden, aber der Wandel in Euch war am offensichtlichsten. Es ist immer noch nicht klar, wie Ihr diese Macht nutzen werdet, aber um unser aller Willen, bete ich, dass Ihr nicht vom Pfad des Gleichgewichtes abkommt. Ich hoffe, dass Ihr beweiset, dass meine Vorsicht unberechtigt ist.~
+@162  = ~Es ist gut, dass Ihr diesen Moment dafür genutzt habt, uns daran zu erinnern, dass trotz all der mächtigen Gegner, die wir besiegt haben, Ihr noch immer nicht Eure Unreife gemeistert habt. Danke für diese Erinnerung, <CHARNAME>.~
+@163  = ~Ja, ich dachte, dass Ihr das wärt. Aber passt auf, unsere Leistungen nicht zu übertreiben... es wäre vorzuziehen, dass die Geschichten unserer Taten sich nicht zu weit verbreiten. Ich... ich würde es sogar vorziehen, nichts davon zu erwähnen, obschon ich fürchte, dass das zuviel von Euch verlangt ist...~
+@164  = ~Das ist eine interessante Beobachtung, Kind. Aber ich habe mich ganz ähnlich wie Ihr gefühlt, während wir da unten waren, es ist gut zu wissen, dass Eure Verbundenheit mit Mutter Natur ebenso stark und wahrhaftig ist wie meine. Ich habe zum Eichenvater gebetet, er möge uns allen Kraft geben, aber ganz besonders Euch, denn ich habe Euer Leiden gesehen. Ich bin froh, dass meine Gebete nicht umsonst waren.~
+@165  = ~Ich zweifle nicht daran, dass Ihr davon gehört habt, dass Sirenen Teile der Küste südlich von Kerzenburg bewvölkern, sie leben is einer Feste an der Küste. Doch ich denke nicht, dass Ihr jemals mit ihnen in Konflikt geraten seid, wenn wir also in ihr Gebiet eindringen, ist das ein wahrscheinlicher Ausgang. Wisset, dass ihre Hauptwaffe ihr Bezauberungsspruch ist, der unseren Geist verdreht und uns dazu bringt, uns gegenseitig zu bekämpfen. Ich würde eine Strategie, das abzuenden, begrüßen, und ich habe davon gehört, dass Kleriker und Zauberer Wesen wie Oger und Skelette beschwören, um die Sirenen in Schach zu halten. Vielleicht ist das eine Option, die wir überdenken sollten.~
+@166  = ~Natürlich mag es sein, dass Ihr gar nicht vorhabt, Euch vor ihrem Bezauberungsspruch zu verteidigen, wenn Ihr gehört habt, dass diese wunderschönen Sirenen manchmal männliche Liebhaber nehmen. Wenn dem so ist, nutze ich die Möglichkeit, Euch daran zu erinnern, dass Gorions Mörder der Gerechtigkeit zuzuführen, immernoch Eure Anwesenheit erfordert.~
+@167  = ~Geht vorerst, "Koveras"...aber wir werden uns wiedersehen, das verspreche ich. Und dankt diesen heiligen Hallen von Kerzenburg und der Gegenwart der Wachleute, sonst würde Euer Blut die Fliesen dieses Bodens beflecken, sowie ich hier spreche!~
+@168  = ~Ich nötige Euch, ihr Angebot abzulehnen, <CHARNAME>.~
+@169  = ~Ich hatte nicht vor, sie mitzunehmen, Jaheira. Eure druidischen Fähigkeiten sind mehr als genug für diese Gruppe.~
+@170  = ~Jaheira, ich vertraue darauf, dass Eure Weisheit sie überzeugt, ihre extremen Ansichten aufzugeben. Sicherlich seid Ihr fähig, dass zu erreichen? Oder seid Ihr absolut sicher, dass ich ihr Angebot ablehnen sollte?~
+@171  = ~Bah, wir brauchen einen weiteren Heiler und sie scheint fähig dazu. Abgesehen davon bin ich ziemlich angetan von der Schatten-Druiden Philosophie...~
+@172  = ~Ich bin froh, dass Ihr so denkt und nicht scheitert, den Grund zu erkennen.~
+@173  = ~*seufzt* Haltet Euch nicht damit auf, Eure Meinung zu verschleiern, <CHARNAME>, ich kann leicht hindurchblicken. Also gut, lasst sie beitreten. Ich werde mein bestes tun, mit ihr auszukommen und sie dabei von der Dummheit ihres Weges zu überzeugen, dennoch werde ich wachsam bleiben. Mein Lohn für meinen Versuch könnte sehr gut ein scharfer Biss dieses tollwütigen Wolfes sein.~
+@174  = ~Ihr seid...WAS? wenn das bloß ein Scherz ist, um mich zu verärgern, dann versichere ich Euch, dass das ein ganz ärmlicher war. Wie auch immer, wenn Eure Worte wahr sind, dann ist da mehr als eine Peson in unserer Gruppe, bei der ich wachsam sein werde.~
+@175  = ~<CHARNAME>, von dieser Gegend gibt es Gerüchte, dass sie voll ist mit Basilisken. Ihr Blick wird jeden von uns versteinern, es sei denn, wir schützen uns mit Sprüchen und Tränken. Sollte Ihr solche Dinge zum Schutz nicht haben, empfehle ich nach Beregost zurück zu kehren. Zumindest wenn also eine Rasenverzierung zu werden, nicht Teil Euren Plans ist.~
+@176  = ~<CHARNAME>, ich weiß, dass dieser Teil des Mantelwaldes schwer verseucht ist mit Waldschraten und Spinnen. Ich würde größte Vorsicht anraten, da diese Kreaturen nicht nur sehr giftig sind, sondern auch hinterhältige Fallen für die Unvorsichtigen stellen. Während ich das Wissen besitze, wie man das gefährliche Gift heilt, wäre es dennoch ratsam einen größeren Vorrat an Gegengiften zu haben... besonders wenn Ihr darauf besteht, diese Gegend mehr als gründlich zu erkunden. ~
+@177  = ~Wartet, <CHARNAME>! Ich sehen jemanden, mit dem ich mehr als nur den Ruf, Druide zu sein, teile, nähert sich uns. Kein Zweifel, er wird mit verbindlichen Informationen über die Gefahren, die dieser Teil des Larswood Waldes bereit hält, dienen.~
+@178  = ~Also, <CHARNAME>... exzessiver Gebrauch des Bilsenkrauts häufiges Versehen bei einigen unerfahrenen Druiden, und ich hoffe, dass wir uns allen eine Lehre sein. Es scheint, dass wir gleich ein paar Antworten bekommen werden.~
+@179  = ~Wir nähern uns dem Gebiet, wo die Schatten-Druiden schreiten. Erlaubt mir, Euch mehr von ihnen zu erzählen, <CHARNAME>. Der Druiden Orden akzeptiert normalerweise viel verschiedenen Philosophien, und dadurch viele verschiedene Verzweigungen... aber nur eine dieser Verzweigungen lebt in dauerhaften Krieg mit den anderen, meist heimlich, aber gelegentlich auch offen. Diese Leute, die Schatten-Druiden, glauben, dass die Natur eine reinigende Kraft ist, die genutzt werden muss, um die Zivilisation zu bekämpfen, die, gemäß ihren Glauben, die Menschheit geschwächt hat.~
+@180  = ~Ihre Versuche, Leute zu ermutigen, ihre Errungenschaften der Zivilisation aufzugeben und zu einer primitiveren Existenz als Jäger und Sammler zurück zu kehren, werden oft mit Aggression und Gewalt durchgeführt. Während sie von sich selbst als fürsorgend für die Natur und das Gleichgewicht denken, können die Mittel, mit denen sie für ihre Ziele kämpfen, grausam und böse sein, gänzlich im Gegensatz zu dem, was der Druiden-Orden vorschlägt. 
+Sie werden uns nicht einfach durch ihr Gebiet ziehen lassen ohne Fragen zu stellen... und sobald sie mich sehen, könnten sie gewalttätig reagieren. Ich zähle auf Eure Unterstützung, <CHARNAME>. ~
+@181  = ~Hmmm... wie ich erwähnte, bin ich ziemlich in Eile, aber da Ihr ernsthaft interessiert scheint...~
+@182  = ~Na na, L-liebes... es würde uns n-nicht gut bekommen, jetzt u-unsere Beherrschung zu verlieren, n-nicht wahr? Alle Schuld w-wird mit der Zeit zurück gezahlt, das werden wir b-beide sicherstellen, z-zusammen... mit der Hilfe von <CHARNAME>, natürlich.~
+@183  = ~G-gorion wäre sehr stolz auf Euch, <CHARNAME>, so weit zu kommen... was j-jetzt kommt, wird uns alle in Lebensgefahr bringen, und nicht alle werden vielleicht zurückkehren, aber... w-wir werden Euch folgen, und das Beste hoffen.~
 @184  = ~Uhhhhmmmm...~
-@185  = ~So, we meet again. Sorry, but I don't... hey, who are you carrying there?~
-@186  = ~It's one of our companions, he was wounded.~
-@187  = ~A hobgoblin we killed. We think he's a member of the Chill, so we're taking him back to Beregost for identification.~
-@188  = ~He's a merchant we found. His caravan was attacked by bandits, and he was badly wounded. He paid us to take him back to Beregost.~
-@189  = ~This is Samuel. We want to turn him in for 50 gold.~
-@190  = ~*sigh* <CHARNAME>, I know it seems difficult to imagine, but not all members of the Flaming Fist are complete meatheads. Though I would not be too surprised if this one buys your ridiculous excuse.~
-@191  = ~Do you feel up to wrestling some ankhegs, <CHARNAME>? I agree that their shells could be used to procure a nice set of armor. But the danger is great, as their mandibles are strong enough to snap a small tree. They may catch you unaware by popping out of the ground in front of you, only to squirt a stream of toxic acid in your face. We have arrived during their mating season, so they will be extremely aggressive.~
-@192  = ~Oooh, they are more aggressive in the period of mating, Jaheira? Uh, is that also true for other... umm, animals?~
-@193  = ~N-n-now, Imoen, I d-don't r-r-really like that t-tone of your voice...~
-@194  = ~Oops! Guess I've been found out.~
-@195  = ~The lizard that just flew over our heads was indeed a wyvern, <CHARNAME>.~
-@196  = ~A most fearsome opponent, its talons can rip apart any overconfident warrior... and watch out for its barbed tail. If the stinger catches you, the poison may kill you, before I have a chance to heal you.~
-@197  = ~My druidic powers, while considerable, are not limitless.~
-@198  = ~You did explain the dangers of wyvern hunting to <CHARNAME> before asking for help, did you not, Coran?~
-@199  = ~But of course... And, if I may add... I find that your natural beauty is even further enhanced by our presence in the forest domain. It makes you appear... like a graceful dryad...~
-@200  = ~But of course... Speaking of <CHARNAME>... do you find that her beauty is even further enhanced by our presence in the forest domain? As graceful as a dryad... is she not?~
-@201  = ~Bah! Why do I even bother addressing you, elf?~
-@202  = ~It is nice of you to say so, <CHARNAME>, but do not make my role more important than that of others. Especially Khalid's, for he showed exceptional skill and courage.~
-@203  = ~N-nonsense, d-dear... I was just trying to do my best, as were we all...~
-@204  = ~That is my husband, <CHARNAME>. Modesty is his second name. Your foster father could have picked no better guardian for you, trust me in this.~
-@1001 = ~To you, as well.~
-@1002 = ~So it does, and so we shall.~
-@1003 = ~Me want to help!~
-@206  = ~Well, they'll sleep better now. Thank you.~
-@207  = ~The law is served.~
-@210  = ~Pay no heed to the idle ramblings of an old man. Farewell, <CHARNAME>, and thank you for the book.~
+@185  = ~So, treffen wir uns wieder. Tut mir leid, aber... hey, wen tragt Ihr da?~
+@186  = ~Das ist einer unserer Kameraden, er wurden verwundet.~
+@187  = ~einen Hobgoblin, der wir getötet haben. Wir denken, er ist ein Mitglied der Kalten Hand, also tragen wir ihn nach Beregost zurück, um ihn zu identifizieren.~
+@188  = ~Er ist ein Händler, den wir gefunden haben. Seine Karavane wurde von Banditen angegriffen und er ist schwer verwundet worden. Er hat uns bezahlt, dass wir ihn nach Beregost zurück tragen.~
+@189  = ~Das ist Samuel. Wir wollen ihn gegen die 50 Goldmünzen ausliefern.~
+@190  = ~*seufzt* <CHARNAME>, ich weiß, das ist schwer vorstellbar, aber nicht alle Mitglieder der Flammenden Faust sind komplette Blödmänner. Dennoch wäre ich nicht zu überrascht, wenn dieser hier Eure lächerliche Ausrede abkaufen würde.~
+@191  = ~Fühlt Ihr Euch gewachsen, mit ein paar Ankhegs zu ringen, <CHARNAME>? Ich stimme zu, dass ihr Panzer genutzt werden kann, um eine ordentliche Rüstung herzustellen. Aber die Gefahr ist groß, da ihre Mandibeln stark genug sind, kleine Bäume zu abzuknipsen. Sie könnten Euch unvorbereitet erwischen, indem sie direkt vor Euch aus dem Boden hochschießen, nur um eien Strahl giftiger Säure in Euer Gesicht zu spritzen. Wir sind während ihrer Paarungszeit eingetroffen, daher werden sie besonders aggressiv sein.~
+@192  = ~Oooh, sie sind also aggressiver während ihrer Paarungszeit, Jaheira? Öh, gilt das auch für andere... ähm, Tiere?~
+@193  = ~N-na, na, Imoen, ich m-mag diesen U-unterton in Eurer Stimme w-wirklich nicht...~
+@194  = ~Oops! Ich denke, ich hab's herausgefunden.~
+@195  = ~Die Echse, die gerade über unsere Köpfe flog, war in der Tat ein Lindwurm, <CHARNAME>.~
+@196  = ~Ein sehr furchterregender Gegner, seine Klauen können jeden vermessenen Krieger zerteilen... und achtet auf seinen mit Stacheln versehenen Schwanz. Wenn Euch ein Stachel erwischt, könnte Euch das Gift töten, bevor ich Chance habe, Euch zu heilen.~
+@197  = ~Meine Druiden-Kräfte sind zwar durchaus beträchtlich, aber nicht unbegrenzt.~
+@198  = ~Ihr habt <CHARNAME> die Gefahren der Lindwurmjagd erklärt, bevor Ihr nach Hilfe gefragt habt, oder, Coran?~
+@199  = ~Aber natürlich... Und wenn ich das hinzufügen darf... Eure natürliche Schönheit wird sogar noch gesteigert, wenn Ihr Euch im Wald aufhaltet. Es läßt Euch... wie eine anmutige Dryade erscheinen...~
+@200  = ~Sicherlich... Wo wir gerade von <CHARNAME> sprechen... findet Ihr nicht, dass ihre Schönheit noch gesteigert wird durch ihre Gegenwart im Wald? Ebenso anmutig wie eine Dryade... ist sie das nicht?~
+@201  = ~Bah! Warum mache ich mir die Mühe, Euch anzusprechen, Elf?~
+@202  = ~Es ist nett von Euch, <CHARNAME>, soetwas zu sagen, aber nehmt meine Rolle nicht wichtiger als die, der anderen. Besonders Khalids, denn er zeigte außergewöhnliches Geschick und Mut. ~
+@203  = ~U-unsinn, L-liebes... ich habe nur versucht, m-mein Bestes zu geben, wie wir es alle tun...~
+@204  = ~Das ist mein Ehemann, <CHARNAME>. Bescheidenheit ist sein zweiter Name. Euer Ziehvater hätte keinen besseren Beschützer für Euch wählen können, vertraut mir.~
+@1001 = ~Für Euch ebenso.~
+@1002 = ~So ist es und so sollten wir auch.~
+@1003 = ~Mich helfen will!~
+@206  = ~Nunja, sie werden jetzt besser schlafen. Danke.~
+@207  = ~Dem Gesetzt ist gedient.~
+@210  = ~Schenkt dem müßigen Geschwafel eines alten Mannes keine Aufmerksamkeit. Lebt wohl, <CHARNAME>, und danke für das Buch.~
